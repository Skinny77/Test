## Jesus is the God we Were Made For

Second, Jesus is the God we were made for.

What's your favourite Christmas film? Maybe your into the classics like White Christmas or Mircale of 34th Street? Or what about a comedy like Love Actually or Elf. If you have young chidlren maybe it it Frozen whether you like it or not.

Opinions are divided in the Maguire household. Abi's favourite Christmas film is Home Alone. My favourite Christmas film is Die hard...

But if I'm honest, Home Alone is a great film too. If you've never seen it, it is a festive comedy about boy who gets accidentally left at home for the Christmas period and ends up having to defend his house against buglars... often with hilarious slapstick results.

But the thing about Home Alone is, that if you miss the beginning it is hard to make sense of what is happening through the film. Where are his parents? Where did these burglars come from? And most of all, why is he home alone?

In a way, the bible is the same. Did you know that the bible has an historical storyline that runs all the way through it? And you might be forgiven for thinking that Jesus' birth is the beginning of that Story, but it is actually the middle. So jumping in at the First Christmas it can be hard to get a handle on the facts.

Take Matthew 1:22-23 for example. There Matthew tells us that the circumstances of Jesus birth would fulfill the words of the prophet, that

> "The virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and they will call him Immanuel” —which means, “God with us.”"

The prophet Matthew is referring to is the Prophet Isaiah, and you can read the prophecy he made over 250 years before Jesus was born in the Old Testament, in Isaiah 7. But Isaiah is not the beginning of the story either.

No the stroy of the bible beginnings in Genesis with God creating a perfect world (how he did it important right now - just that he did), then the story shifts its focus to a Garden where three people are living in a perfect community.

That's right, three people. Adam, the first man, Eve, the first woman, and the God who made them. Adam and Eve could have called God immaunuel in those days because he really was with them. He walked and talked with them and they with hiim.

But that all changed when one day Adam and Eve disobeyed God. They failed to love God and each other as they ought. In their pride they wanted to be like God and so they rebelled against God. God was left with no choice, he sent them out of the garden and out of his presence forever. He was no longer their Immanuel. He couldn't be, God cannot live among sinful people.

For every generation after them they'd be conflict between God and humanity. But scattered throughout the bible storyline was a promise, like this one in Leviticus 26:12, where God says:

> I will walk among you and be your God, and you will be my people.

It's a promise that one day God would restore the relationship between himself and humanity. Once again he would be there God, their Immanuel, the God who made them for himself, and they would be his people.

So when Matthew quotes Isaiah's ancient prophecy, he doesn't just want us to notice how Jesus would be born - to a virgin - just as Isaiah predicted all those years ago and Just the Angel told Joesph he would be. But also, what the virgin birth would tells us about Jesus' idenity.

He is the promised Immanuel, he is God with us. And this is one of the most wonderful and beautiful truths of the Crhsitian faith. That God actually entered into our world become human in every way, yet never ceased to be God.

Jesus is God the Son who lived among us as a human person, dying in the place of the people who had and would disobey him, people that he made, and gave life to. For them, for us, for you, he died, taking our punishmeant and giving us his perfect record.

But better yet, Jesus also rose from the dead three days later to restore our relationship with him so that we he be our God and we would be his people. Coming to live within us through the Holy Spirit, as our Immanuel, God with us wherever we go, what we face.

And one day, he tells us that he will come to earth again. Not as baby, but as a victorious king, perfectly restoring our world, our lives, our bodies, our communities, our families, everything.

ON that day, everyone who has trusted in Jesus to forgive their sins will be with him forever. On that day he will be our God and we will be his people. On that Day, Jesus will once again be our Immanuel, 'God with us', in a way that Isaiah and Joesph could only dream off. God and the people he made living together in perfect joy and perfect harmony, forever.

But this promise is only for those whose hope is in Jesus. Jesus' can only be immanuel with those who are willing to humble themselves and admit that like Adam and Eve they have not loved God and others as they ought. Only those who are willing to trust in Jesus for forgiveness and turn away from their old way of life can enjoy this relationship with God now and forever.

If we are not willing to come to God on his terms, then the only thing we can expect after our death is the that we face the terms of God's justice in hell.

So please, this Christmas, don't stop at the baby in manger, but give your life to him! Bow and worship him as God come to live for you, to die for you, to raise for you, and will one day return for you if your trust is in him.

For christian's it is Christmas everyday, because everyday our Saviour Jesus is with us. And one day we will be with him forever as his people and he will be with us as our God.

This hope can be yours too. Maybe this Christmas you'll find in Jesus the hope and joy that comes from a renewed relationship with the God who made you to be with him.
