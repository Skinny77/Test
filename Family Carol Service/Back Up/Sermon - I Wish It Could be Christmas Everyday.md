# Sermon - I Wish It Could be Christmas Everyday

## Christmas in August?

> It was August 1973.
>
> Men women were heading to and from work in stylish suits; hippies were hanging out in the parks; and parents were complained that their children's jeans were too wide and that their the shorts were well... too short!
>
> In the charts, Gary Glitter was four week steark at number one with 'I'm the leader of the gang'. But was about dethroned with by dreamy eyed Donny Osmond's 'Young Love'. No one was thinking about Christmas, a wouldn't be for sometime.
>
> In London the temperature had been steadily climbing for weeks. Before the month was over it would top out at a roasting 87F... about 31C.
>
> But in an out of the way recording studio paid for by EMI records, things were very different.
>
> The fans were blowing freezing air. Baubles and tinsel hung from instrument stands and microphone cables, there was even a Christmas tree in the corner. Completely unknown to the world outside, that afternoon Roy Wood and his then unknown band, 'Wizzard', were about to make Christmas history.
>
> _I Wish It Could Be Christmas Everday_ was born.
>
> Even though the song never made it to Christmas number one, with over 6 million views and 1,800 comments on YouTube this 45 year old glam rock song is still as big a Christmas anthemn as ever! Maybe even bigger!
>
> But despite it's catchy chorus and clever rock and roll style, the Adventurers done a fantastic job of showing us why none of us would want that kind of Christmas everyday.

So is the problem that Wizzard over sold us a dream of Christmas that can't measure up? I'm not convinced. I don't think Wizzard oversold how great it would to have Christmas everyday. No I think they've undersold it! They're offering you chocolate coins when their is a box of Guylians with your name on it!

So if you are willing to hear me out, I'd like to take you back two thousands years to a family expecting a baby. A baby who for that family (and for us!) would make everyday into Christmas day.

It would be a Christmas that would change their lives for ever... it might even change your life.

But to explain what I mean we need to take a closer look at the passage we heard earlier. So if there is a bible in front of you, you might want to grab it and open it to Matthew 1:18-25. Page <!-- TODO: Add page number --> in the red bibe.

We're going to focus on the Angel's message to Joesph. A message that gives us two incredible snapshots of the who the baby in the manger really is. Here they are:

1.  Jesus is the saviour we desperately need (v21)
2.  Jesus is the God we were made for (v22-23)

## 2.  Jesus is the saviour we desperately need (v21)

First, Jesus is the saviour we desperately need.

Last week, some friends and I went up to London to do the Crystal Maze Experience. If you've never heard of the Crystal Maze it was a game show from the 90s in which teams of eight raced to solve 12 puzzles split across 4 zones to win Crystal. Each crystal gained the team 5 seconds in the crystal dome at the end of the show where they had to collect gold tickets to win prizes. simple

Puzzle feel into four categories, physical, mental, mystery, or skill and usually had to be completed in under three minutes. Fail to get out in time and you were locked in. The point of the Experience was that you got to go around the set with a maze master, play the puzzles, win crystals, and try to beat the doom.

Now I watched a lot of Crystal Maze growing up. And whilst it looks easy enough from the comfort of your own sofa, when you are in a puzzle room, against the clock, with all your mates shouting at you, I can tell you your mind turns to jelly and it is easy to crack under the pressure. And funnily enough, several of us did just that. The puzzle sounded simply enough, but when it came to the crunch we crumpled in the face of an impossible task.

If you were at the Adventurers Parents evening a couple of Weeks ago. You'll remember how in Matthew 22:37-40 Jesus' gives us a really neat summary of what God says a good life is supposed to look like. Jesus says that the good life it is to **"Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind"** and to **"Love your other people like you love yourself**"

Sound simple enough, doesn't it. Be a loving person, sorted, I can do that, piece of cake. I'm already a decent loving person as it is thanks.

Then Jesus tells us, as one translation puts it, that

> "The entire law and all the demands of the prophets are based on these two commandments."

Oh.

Did you catch that. Jesus says that every law God ever gave for people to live by is summed up in those two: Love God with everything you are and love others like yourself. Which means...

Every time we use God's name as a swaer word, every time we dishour our parents, everytime we get angry at someone, gossip behind their back, deceive someone, eat too much, drink too much, fail to be generous, fail to be kind, obey God just to get what we want, the list goes on. Everytime we do those things and more we are failing to love God and failing to love others.

All this means that actually being fairly loving isn't loving enough, if these two commands summ up everything the bible says about human life. Then the only way to be that loving is to be perfect. I don't know about you, but I certainly am incapable of loving God and other humans perfectly. FOr me it is an imppossble task. If you're honest with yourself, can you?

The bible calls this failure to be perfectly loving towards God and other, sin. And sin separates us from God, it makes it impossible to know God and to experience the life he has for us. Worse still this is his law we are braking, it makes us Criminals in his eyes destined to face his justice and experience hell when this life is over. That bad news.

Here is some good news, it dosen't have to be that way In Matthew 1:21 the angel says to Joesph that,

> "[Mary] will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins."

Jesus' name  means the "Lord God Saves" and this is exactly what Jesus was born to do, to save his people from their sins. We might not be able to love God and others perfectly but Jesus can and Jesus did. He lived a life of perfect love for God and others, and he lived it on our behalf.

He also lived a perfect human life to die a perfect death on our behalf. You see the baby born in Bethlehem would thirty-odd years later die on a Roman Cross. And there on the cross all the anger and justice of God against our sin, our law-brekaing, would be poured out on Jesus so that Jesus perfect record could be transfered to us.

Did you catch that? It's truly amazing!

On the cross Jesus became like us, a criminal and law-breaker in God's eyes so that we could become like him - perfect and right in God's eyes. He received the punishment that would have been ours, so that we could live the life God always intended for us. A life where we would learn to love God and love others. A life of joy, and meaning, and purpose. A life of etneral significance.

The moment we place our trust in Jesus for forgiveness and commit to live differently, life begins again and continues that way forever. Jesus was born to die to make this new life available for us, for you.

For Christian, everyday is Christmas day because everyday we remember that the baby in the manger grew up to be our saviour. A Saviour who has changed our lives forever, and he can change your life too.

Because Jesus is the saviour we desperately need.

## Jesus is the God we Were Made For

Second, Jesus is the God we were made for.

What's your favourite Christmas film? Maybe your into the classics like White Christmas or Mircale of 34th Street? Or what about a comedy like Love Actually or Elf. If you have young chidlren maybe it it Frozen whether you like it or not.

Opinions are divided in the Maguire household. Abi's favourite Christmas film is Home Alone. My favourite Christmas film is Die hard...

But if I'm honest, Home Alone is a great film too. If you've never seen it, it is a festive comedy about boy who gets accidentally left at home for the Christmas period and ends up having to defend his house against buglars... often with hilarious slapstick results.

But the thing about Home Alone is, that if you miss the beginning it is hard to make sense of what is happening through the film. Where are his parents? Where did these burglars come from? And most of all, why is he home alone?

In a way, the bible is the same. Did you know that the bible has an historical storyline that runs all the way through it? And you might be forgiven for thinking that Jesus' birth is the beginning of that Story, but it is actually the middle. So jumping in at the First Christmas it can be hard to get a handle on the facts.

Take Matthew 1:22-23 for example. There Matthew tells us that the circumstances of Jesus birth would fulfill the words of the prophet, that

> "The virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and they will call him Immanuel” —which means, “God with us.”"

The prophet Matthew is referring to is the Prophet Isaiah, and you can read the prophecy he made over 250 years before Jesus was born in the Old Testament, in Isaiah 7. But Isaiah is not the beginning of the story either.

No the stroy of the bible beginnings in Genesis with God creating a perfect world (how he did it important right now - just that he did), then the story shifts its focus to a Garden where three people are living in a perfect community.

That's right, three people. Adam, the first man, Eve, the first woman, and the God who made them. Adam and Eve could have called God immaunuel in those days because he really was with them. He walked and talked with them and they with hiim.

But that all changed when one day Adam and Eve disobeyed God. They failed to love God and each other as they ought. In their pride they wanted to be like God and so they rebelled against God. God was left with no choice, he sent them out of the garden and out of his presence forever. He was no longer their Immanuel. He couldn't be, God cannot live among sinful people.

For every generation after them they'd be conflict between God and humanity. But scattered throughout the bible storyline was a promise, like this one in Leviticus 26:12, where God says:

> I will walk among you and be your God, and you will be my people.

It's a promise that one day God would restore the relationship between himself and humanity. Once again he would be there God, their Immanuel, the God who made them for himself, and they would be his people.

So when Matthew quotes Isaiah's ancient prophecy, he doesn't just want us to notice how Jesus would be born - to a virgin - just as Isaiah predicted all those years ago and Just the Angel told Joesph he would be. But also, what the virgin birth would tells us about Jesus' idenity.

He is the promised Immanuel, he is God with us. And this is one of the most wonderful and beautiful truths of the Crhsitian faith. That God actually entered into our world become human in every way, yet never ceased to be God.

Jesus is God the Son who lived among us as a human person, dying in the place of the people who had and would disobey him, people that he made, and gave life to. For them, for us, for you, he died, taking our punishmeant and giving us his perfect record.

But better yet, Jesus also rose from the dead three days later to restore our relationship with him so that we he be our God and we would be his people. Coming to live within us through the Holy Spirit, as our Immanuel, God with us wherever we go, what we face.

And one day, he tells us that he will come to earth again. Not as baby, but as a victorious king, perfectly restoring our world, our lives, our bodies, our communities, our families, everything.

ON that day, everyone who has trusted in Jesus to forgive their sins will be with him forever. On that day he will be our God and we will be his people. On that Day, Jesus will once again be our Immanuel, 'God with us', in a way that Isaiah and Joesph could only dream off. God and the people he made living together in perfect joy and perfect harmony, forever.

But this promise is only for those whose hope is in Jesus. Jesus' can only be immanuel with those who are willing to humble themselves and admit that like Adam and Eve they have not loved God and others as they ought. Only those who are willing to trust in Jesus for forgiveness and turn away from their old way of life can enjoy this relationship with God now and forever.

If we are not willing to come to God on his terms, then the only thing we can expect after our death is the that we face the terms of God's justice in hell.

So please, this Christmas, don't stop at the baby in manger, but give your life to him! Bow and worship him as God come to live for you, to die for you, to raise for you, and will one day return for you if your trust is in him.

For christian's it is Christmas everyday, because everyday our Saviour Jesus is with us. And one day we will be with him forever as his people and he will be with us as our God.

This hope can be yours too. Maybe this Christmas you'll find in Jesus the hope and joy that comes from a renewed relationship with the God who made you to be with him.

## Christmas Everyday?

This might surprise you but did you know that CHristian's don't have to celebrate Christmas?

It's true, the Bible says alot about how Jesus was born and why it matters, but it doesn't say anything about how or when to celebrate it. In fact, it tells us to think carefully, about why we celebrate the events we do. Paul, one of the New Testament writers, says in Romans 14:5,

> One man considers one day more sacred than another; another man considers every day alike. Each one should be fully convinced in his own mind.

So Tree or no tree, Santa, stockings, presents, carols, nativity display, advent calendar... the bible leaves it to each person to decided according to their own conscience how they are to mark the birth of Jesus, if at all.

Now that is not to say celebrating christmas is a bad thing, it is a good thing. But what is easy to forget is that we are not holding all of these Christmas services because we have to, but because we want to. Every year we take take the month of December, and December 25th in particular to remember something which is true all year around.

That God the Son came to earth as a baby born to a virgin the little town of Bethlehem.

One day a year to remember that the baby in the manger grew up to die for our sins so that we could know the joy of forgiveness and the meaning and purposes that comes from having a restored relationship with God who made us. For those who trust in Jesus this is true all year round, whether it is 25th December or the 1st June.

For Christians we take Christmas day, to remember that it is in fact Christmas everyday. It might not be the kind of Christmas that Roy Wood and Wizzard were wishing for in their Christmas song. There's no snow, winter walks, or visits from Santa. But as we've seen throughout this service. Wizzard's dream of Christmas everyday both underpromises and underdelivers.

"I Wish it could be Christmas Everday" under promises and undelivers because the things we obsess over every year - presents, food, snow - are just the wrapping paper of God's Christmas present to the world. And like toddlers it be so easy for us to spend so much time playing with the wrapping paper that we don't relaise we supposed to be delighting in the Amazing Gift our Heavenly Father has for us. HIs one and only son. Jesus.

Jesus. The baby who came that first Christmas. Jesus. The saviour we so desperately need. Jesus. The God we were made for.

For Christian it really is Christmas everyday, and it can be for you too. If you this Christmas you give your life to Jesus so that he can give you etneral life.

Let's pray.
