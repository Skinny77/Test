3/. Was the bread and wine really Jesus body and blood? {Vote}: Hands up for yes? Hands for no?

5/. What are they to remember?

6/. Later we saw Jesus praying in the Garden of Gethsemane. In the video, after Satan tempted him to run away, Jesus prayers to God the Father and says "Not my will but yours will be done". What was Jesus talking about?

7/. How does this help us understand why Jesus let himself be arrested?
