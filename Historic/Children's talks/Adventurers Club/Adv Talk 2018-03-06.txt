Time stamp: 43.00 - 53.45mins

Ok so a big chunk of the film this week. Alot to remember, but I think you can do it.

Here we go...

**1.  About half way through the video Jesus did something incredible! What did he do?**

**2.  What did Lazerus' family and friends think about him coming back to life?**

**3.  What did the religious leaders think about it?**

**4.  How did it make them feel about Jesus? What did they decide to do to him?**

**5.  What did Jesus do when he entered the temple?**

**6   What did the religious leader choose this point to ask Jesus a question about taxes?**

**7.  What did they hope the Roman soilders might do?**

**8.  Jesus showed them a coin with Ceasars face on it and then he said something to the crowds that left them all speechless. What did he say?**

**9.  Jesus said, "Give to Caesar what is Caesar's, but give to God what is God's". Jesus told them to pay their taxes because the coins were made in Ceasar's image, his face, and stamp, was one them. So if the they we supposed to give their coins to Caesar, what were they supposed to give to God?**

The Bible tells us that every human being is made in God's image. We are made in his likeness, his stamp is on our lives. That means we belong to God. Jesus was telling them to give their money to Caesar becuae it belongs to him, but we should give our lives to God, because we belong to him.

**10. How do we give our lives to God?**

We give our lives to God by trusting in the Lord Jesus death for our sins and his return to live. And by turning our back on sin and choosing to live his way.

Let's pray.
