# Sunday School Workshop 2018 - Teaching Scripture; Changing Lives (Notes)

## Session 0

### Welcome

Thanks so much for coming this morning.

Today is about three things:

1.  An opportunity for me to say 'thank you' to you for all of your hardwork and dedication over the last year.

2.  To provide you a specific opportunity to grow and develop in your Sunday School practice by pushing you out of your comfort zone a little...

3.  And help you develop as a team.

AS before I have a book for you to take away. The purpose of this book is to invest in you as a disciple of Jesus first, and teacher, second. This years book is the 'New City Catechism Devotional'.

A sort of reflective Q&A for Christians. It provides answers and defintions on key questions and topics about Christianity. Covering what we are to believe, how are to live, and what motivates us in the Christian life.

Many of the summary answer could be simplified for use it sunday school. {Example} So tag the pages you find most helpful as you go through and keep close at hand on a sunday.

### GDPR & Safeguarding - Sunday School Registration Form

Before we begin proper, I wanted to talk to you about something we are implanting at a Creche and Sunday SChool in light of GDPR and some safeguarding reflections on best practice. And that is a registration form for all Children.

There are two forms on your table, one for regular attenders and one for guests. As Sunday School teachers, all you need to be familiar with is the guest form. Whenever a new family arrive to drop their children off for sunday school, you give them a form and pen, they complete it, you keep hold of it for the lesson and then pass it on to me.

I'll then add their details to a new register document that I'll be putting together. Quarterly, they'll be a review and if we haven't seen the family for three months their be removed from the register.

FAmilies who begin attending regularly, or who are already regular attenders I'll ask to complete the second form on your table. This is simply a more detailed version version of the first form. And again this data will be on your registers.

I'll ensure you have a stack of the guest form in each classroom and ensure that you get a look at the draft register once it is ready. How does that sound? Any questions?

Ok well with the notices out of the way, let me pray and we'll crack on with the morning.

### Aims and Outcomes

If you turn to page 3 in your handout you'll see the timetable for the day and also our aim and outcomes.

**Aim:** In what ways does Scripture require ‘change’, and how do we teach to bring about change in the lives of the children?

**Outcomes:** 4 Questions we should have answered by the end of today

1.  _What is our motivation for Sunday school work?_

2.  _What is biblical change and what motivates it?_

3.  _How do we plan lessons that are focused gospel-change?_

4.  _How do we foster a culture of change on a sunday?_

### Vision and Values (9:40)

-   As we bgin to think about these things, it is worth reminding ourselves of what we are trying to achieve in Sunday school.
-   So, If you turn to page 4 in the handout you'll see our Vision and values statement.


-   Three things here

    -   First, we have our focus verse from Luke 24:27, **“And beginning with Moses and all the prophets, Jesus explained to them what was said in all the scriptures concerning himself.”**
        -   Why?
            -   Scripture is about Jesus.
            -   Teaching scripture is making Jesus known.
    -   Second, is our vision statement. We want to be people who are "Teaching the Gospel, Maturing Disciples, Changing Lives".
        -   based on church mission statement.
    -   finally, how we wil achieve this. Six ways:
        1.  A Correct environment
        2.  A passion team
        3.  A Christ focus to Teaching
        4.  A Gospel-approach to Teaching
        5.  A partnership with parents
        6.  A dedication to prayer

-   Why go over this ever year?

    -   clarity
    -   focus
    -   a way to set goals
    -   an objective way to celebrate success and intifiy areas for gfrowth.
    -   finally, it guides us in our prayers. Which is what we are going to do now.

**{Pray for ten fifteen mins}**
