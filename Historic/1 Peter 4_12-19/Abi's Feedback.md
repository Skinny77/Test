Section 2 - I get where you want to go with the tatchell story, just not convinced :( sorry.

Just think it might be an unnecessary barrier and something a bit more like one of these would have the same effect. <https://www.yesmagazine.org/people-power/10-everyday-acts-of-resistance-that-changed-the-world>

Peter's point is simple. -

It is but I think maybe you could simplify it a bit, maybe I’ve misinterpreted but it sounds quite complicated the way you’ve said it.

‘No it is a reminder that pursuing God's good life in times of opposition requires God's good grace to be at work in our hearts. And that means prayer’ - see above point on application . Just needs a sentence on why that = prayer

Otherwise a good section

Section 3:

Your conclusion is great

There is also a purifying element to that judgemeant, where, as God makes all things new he pruges that new creation of everything that does not conform to his standard of goodness. - I like this a lot, but can you find a verse to back it up, might help to reference

The sobering truth is that in the final judgement they will be purged by the God's good and holy justice as he purifies the universe. - again a good point, but Very theological and booky. I know that you were trying to use the same language as the above paragraph but I think you don’t have enough space to explain properly so it comes across wrong. I wonder if you could make this a bit simpler, linguistically.

That couldn't be further from what Peter is saying in these verses.  - are you talking about 1-1 links here? As it’s really not clear because you move on in the paragraph before. Reading this as it is. It sounds like you are saying that ‘gods discipline is as much about bringing out the good’ is further from what peter is saying.

Again (although this one not as bad) the link to evangelism is a little jumping, or jarring, was it an afterthought?

I like your conclusion, a good way to round it off
