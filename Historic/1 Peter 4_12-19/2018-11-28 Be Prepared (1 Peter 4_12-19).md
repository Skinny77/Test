What do we do with a passage 1 Peter 4:12-19?

Well, this morning, we're going to see that whatever our situition.

Peter wants us to be "Be Prepared" to be opposed for our faith when the time comes.

Surprisingly, he is going to do that, by showing us how **God will use persecution for our good.**

[Repeat]

Peter gives us three examples of how God uses Persecution for our good. Here they are:

1.  Persecution increases our joy (v12-13)
2.  Persecution builds our confidence (v14-16)
3.  Persecution fuels our perseverance (v17-19)

[Repeat]

## 1.  Persecution increases our joy (v12-13)

Firstly, Persecution increases our joy (v12-13)

> Charles Simeon's story is a great one.
>
> But it can be discouraging too.
>
> Do you know that people often said that Simeon was one of th people most joyful men you could meet?
>
> How did he manage that?
>
> After all, our culture seems to say: if you want a good life you need to go with the grain of society, not against it!
>
> Maybe joy in persecution is only for historical heroes, like Charles Simeon...
>
> Or is it?
>
> Well if we take today's passage at face value,
>
> then joy in opposition, can actually be part of the everyday experience of everday Christian's like you and me.

So where does this joy come from? v12-13 are going to tell us. Let's start at v12.

**Dear friends, do not be surprised at the painful trial you are suffering, as though something strange were happening to you.**

The first thing we see is that opposition to the gospel should not surprise us.

Peter says, we can ask God for help when face opposition but we're not to ask why it is happening to us.

Because We're to expect it frmo time to time.

Having gone through Peter's letter, this advice makes sense.

The word 'suffering' pops up 9 times in chapters 1-4. 4 times he talks about us being insulted or mocked. And twice times he shows how Jesus is a model of how to suffer persecution well.

_Peter wants us to to see that the more we think about Jesus death on the cross for our sins, the more prepared we'll be to carry our own cross in service of of our savour._

_The more we think about Jesus suffering for us; the more willing we will be to suffer for him when the time comes._

_Peter wants to make sure that we have the right tools in our kit bag. So that when we face opposition we'll 'be prepared'._

> Ok, you might be thinking. 'Liam, I'm with you on being prepared to face opposition for what I believe. I don't like the idea, but what your saying makes sense.'
>
> 'But joyful in persecution? Come on? Really?'

well, Take a look at v13.

**"But rejoice that you participate in the sufferings of Christ, so that you may be overjoyed when his glory is revealed."**

To participate in the sufferings of Christ is to experience the same kinds of oppositon that Jesus faced.

There's nothing magical about it.

It misunderstood, misrepresented, and mistreated whilst trying to livefor God in a hostile society.

Peter says that when we face that kind of opposition we are to be glad, to rejoice and praise God.

Amazingly though, Peter says that how we respond to suffering for Jesus now has a direct impact on how we'll respond when Jesus returns.

If we gladly endure opposition for being a Christian now then we'll be overjoyed when Jesus' returns.

> In J. R. R. Tolkein's _The Lord of the Rings_, the two main characters Sam and Frodo spend most of the book thinking that their the friend Gandalf died trying to protect them.
>
> It is only at the very end of the book they discover that Gandalf is still alive... He's how that meeting is described. Listen to this: Sam speaks first.
>
> **“Gandalf! I thought you were dead! But then I thought I was dead myself. Is everything sad going to come untrue? What's happened to the world?"**
>
> **"A great Shadow has departed,"** said Gandalf, and then he laughed and the sound was like music, or like water in a parched land; and as he listened the thought came to Sam that he had not heard laughter, the pure sound of merriment, for days upon days without count.”

Did you catch that, Tolkien tells us that Sam's joy at being reunited with his old friend is greater for having endured the hardship in the lead up to their reunion.

I wonder what joy and comfort Same would have had if he'd known all along, with certain hope, that he's old friend was waiting for him at the end of the journey?

In a simiar way, Peter says, we gladly go suffering for Jesus now, delighting in God inspire of it,

because of the greater joy that awaits us when Jesus returns.

Its not that the this joy makes the pain and difficulty go away,

but it does bring comfort and lifts our eyes to day God's people will be with Jesus finally and forever.

Those who oppose the gospel want discourage us to the point where we either give up entirely or feel too ashamed to speak up.

But In God's staggering love for us he uses persecution to increase our delight in Christ.

The challenge is, that to rejoice in suffering for the gospel, many of us,

myself included, first need to repent of our lack of joy generally.

We need to remember that Christian joy comes from reflecting on what Jesus has done for us.

which means...

If we want to be joyful, especially in times of persecution,

-   we need to hear the gospel reguarly,
-   read about it daily,
-   and sing it and pray it into our hearts constantly

so that our _feelings_ not just our thoughts and actions can be become more Christlike.

More like the Jesus described in Hebrews 12:1-3 "who for the _joy_ set before him _endured_ the cross, scorning its shame."

Endure persecution because it increases your joy.

## 2. Persecution because it leads to perseverance (14-16)

Secondly, Persecution builds our confidence (14-16)

> This might surpsise you but as a child I was not that great at physical activities. Shocking... I know!
>
> I wasn't on any sports teams, but I was a cub scout. I never earnt many badges but I loved the meetings and especially the challenge camp.
>
> Challenge camp was when all the cub scout troops in our area came together and competed in challenges against one another.
>
> I was alright at the obstacle course. Other were quicker than me on climbing wall.
>
> And I really stunk at archery and air rifles. No really. I was terrible.
>
> Our team didn't do well overall, but I still got my challenge camp badge at the end of the weekend.
>
> Now when I went to Cubs that next week, with my challenge camp badge sown on my jumper.
>
> Do you think I was more confident in my scouting or less confident?
>
> I was more confident, even though I hadn't done well at camp, I still completed all the challenges.
>
> And I had grown in confidence that cubs scouts was for me.
>
> In these next verses Peter is going to show us that rather than discouraging us,
>
> the challenges we face sharing are faith are supposed to build our confidence not ruin it.

This is another way God uses persecution for our good.

Take a look at v15.

**If you are ridiculed for the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you**

I'm going to go out on a limb here and guess that most of us don't see being mocked for our faith as a blessing.

But Peter says that when we face opposition because of our way of life we are blessed because it actually provides us with evidence that we really are a christian.

Romans 10:9 is clear that

**"If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved."**

But how can we know that our faith is real?

How can I know that I'm not triking myself?

Well the New Testament gives us a number of ways. And, I've listed some for your in the notes.

And Peter describes one of those ways in this verse.

When we face hostile oppostion for our beliefs and endure it, its evidence that the Holy Spirit is at work in our lives.

It is evidence that our faith is genuine.

Being mocked for our faith isn't a blessing because Gpd wants us to believe that evil is good and good is evil.

Its a blessing, because in his love and power, God can even use harsh words and snide comments for our good.

Our opponents seek to use words shame us into silence but our loving heveanly father

takes those words and turns them into bricks which reinforce the foundations of our faith.

which means that instead of giving up we thank God that our opponents see Jesus in our actions and in our character.

Because they are only rejecting us; they're rejecting the see Jesus in us and in our message.

But Peter has a warning for us too. Look at verses 15-16:

**If you suffer, it should not be as a murderer or thief or any other kind of criminal, or even as a meddler. However, if you suffer as a Christian, do not be ashamed, but praise God that you bear that name.**

Peter's point is this. God will only use the insults that come at us as a result of living for _his_ good life.

> If i'm are insulted because I'm worse than those around me or because i'm always poking my nose in other people business. That's not going to reassure me that I'm a Christian...
>
> If anything it is cause for serious soul searching and prayerful repentence.
>
> Remember if we fail to speak up, avoid an opportunity to share the gospel, or even deny Jesus when under social pressure that doesn’t mean we can't genuine Christian.
>
> Peer pressure is powerful thing isn't it?. We all like to be liked and we all want to fit in rather than stand out.
>
> Even Peter denied Jesus three times rather than risk dying along side him!

But if we face opposition because our lives display Jesus to such an extent that people don't like it and tell us so.

Well, that is no reasons to be ashamed, Peter says,

it is a reason to praise God that you really do belong to Jesus and other people see it too.

Which is exactly how God use persecution build our confidence.

## 3. Persecution fuels our perseverance (17-19)

Finally, persecution fuels our perseverance (v17-19)

> Discipline. I wonder what comes to mind when you hear the word discipline. What you think about it is likely affected by a number of things.
>
> Things like you age..
>
> If you are over thirty there is a good chance you see discipline largely as a good thing. Something a person form character and find their a palce in the community.
>
> If you are under thirty your more likely to think that discipline is a more negative thing. Something unloving and restrictive. A last resort to get someone to do what you want.
>
> Or how your parents disciplined you.
>
> If you feel that they were fair, compassionate.
>
> reassuring you that what they were doing was out of love and for your good.
>
> Even if you didn't always agree with their actions or their methods,
>
> you're more likely to see discipline positively,
>
> IF you look back and feel your parents' discipline was harsh, or disproportional. Then you may well see it more as a bad thing.
>
> THere are other things too: education level, experience, ethnicity, where you grew up, and, of course, Christian maturity.
>
> A lot goes into how we view that one little word.

But it is important that we recognise any baggage we might be carrying about the word 'discipline', beucase if don't we are going to struggle to see what Peter says in v17 as a good thing.

v17.

**"For the time has come for judgment to begin with God’s household"**

> Now you might be thinking, "I thought that being a Christian meant I wouldn't have to face judgement?" or "I thought the judgement was later? When Jesus returned?"
>
> Or just "What on earth does that mean?"
>
> Well to understand what Peter is saying let's back up for moment.

Firstly, you're right.

Christian's will escape the final judgement.

Peter's already said it v13, when Jesus returns ours will be full of joy at seeing God's purposes completed.

Joy is what awaits those who trust in Christ, not a just legal sentence that results in us being confined to hell.

But the final judgement is more than just a giant court room where every wrong is righted, and every sinful action called to account.

It is also about God getting ready to remake the universe by purging everything and everyone that is not good, right, and perfect.

For the non-Chrisitian that means unless they turn to Christ, there is no place for them God's new Creation.

The hard truth is that in the final judgement they will be removed as God gets ready to remake the Universe.

But this idea of a purfying judgement isn't unique to Peter,

it pops in the Old Testameant as early as Genesis 3 when Adam and Eve are sent packing from the Garden of Eden,

and it pops up at the end of the bible in Rev 21:7-8.

Where King Jesus lists all those who'll have no place in his New Creation kingdom.

Its sobering stuff. No wonder Peter says in v17-18:

**If [Judgement] begins with us, what will the outcome be for those who do not obey the gospel of God? And, “If it is hard for the righteous to be saved, what will become of the ungodly and the sinner?”﻿﻿**

But Christians, are New Creation people. Paul puts it this way in 2 Corinthians 5:17: **Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, [they are] a new creation; the old has gone, the new has come!**

Did you catch that?

> When you become a Christian the new creation burst into this old world.
>
> When that happen you changed from being spiritually dead and doomed to hell to being spiritually alive and destined for eternity with God.

So we've escaped the final judgemeant! Praise God! THat's good news.

But there is still purifying that needs to happen in our lives, right?.

> Our lives need to come under the scrutiny of God's holiness so that he can use his good discipline to make us more like Jesus.
>
> And that is what Peter is talking about here. Persecution as discipline.
>
> In God's love and kindness he uses the persecution as a way to lovingly break our attraction to idols.
>
> He uses it to purge us of sin.
>
> He uses it to make us more like Jesus.

I think it is really important to see that Peter doesn't make any one-to-one links between specific sins and the opposition we face.

The discipline-judgement that Peter talks about here describes the general way God uses persecution.

But Peter's general principle has a pointed application.

Take a look at  v19 **So then, those who suffer according to God’s will should commit themselves to their faithful Creator and continue to do good.**

Like all good parents, God's use discipline to discourage bad characteristics, and to develop godly qaulities too!

And Peter he has one particular quality of godliness in mind: perseverance!

following Jesus no matter what.

That's what perserevence means - following Jesus no matter what.

Look this is really important.

Really important. THat means God's discipline does not lead to guilt ('God's punishing me'), but godliness ('God will use this to keep me following Jesus!').

Get this, in v17-19, Peter says that:

Far from driving us away God, the Lord will uses opposition to drive us in deeper into his love and care.

Instead of causing us to give up, it makes us more committed to pursuing our Heavenly Father and the good life he has for us.

Our oppoenants use their words and actions to silence us or make us give up, but God in his grace uses it for our good.

Endure persecution because it fuels our perseverance.

## Conclusion: What About Charles Simeon? What about you?

In many ways, Charles Simeon's life is an 18th Century case study on 1 Peter 4:12-19.

It was after a mesreable day in Cambridge when Simeon realised that if Jesus suffered for him, the least he could do was being will to suffer for his saviour.

It wasn't that he should go looking for it, but he wasn't to surprised when it came along. He knew he needed to be prepared.

He he came to see it as a way for God's grace to be at work in his life. A way to make him pursue the Good life good had for him with joy, confidence, and maturing character.

Thinking about that day, Charles Simeon wrote in his journal that "I henceforth bound persecution as a wreath of glory round my brow."

And that is exactly how he lived.

His joy, his confidence, and his character came through in his preaching and eventually the Holy Spirit to melted the hard hearts at Holy Trinity, Cambridge.

By the end of his life, Simeon had inspired an entire generation of gospel preachers and missionaries.

We live in an age when more and more we find ourselves a minority in our homes, our communities, and our workplaces. And increasingly, an opposed one at that.

But that opposition is not meant to silence, discourage, or cause us to give up.

God will that evil to our good for his glory.

He does that by making opposition and persecution help us increase in joy, grow in confidence, and keeping going to the very end.

Peter knew it; Charles Simeon knew it; and know we know it too. The question is: do we believe it?

Let's pray.
