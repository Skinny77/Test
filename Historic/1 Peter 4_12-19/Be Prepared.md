# Sermon: Be Prepared (1 Peter 4:12-19)

## The True Story of Young Preacher

That morning, over tea and biscuits, the church hall was buzzing with the news.

Sadly, not that long ago their vicar had died unexpectedly, and they'd just discovered who was going to replace him.

They had set their hearts on one man in particular for the role. He had spoken at the church many times and they were all impressed by his forward thinking attitude.

A man who understood that the times and culture had changed, and if the church wanted to survive, it's beliefs would have to change too. Doctrine had its place but it was action that matter mosted. "Deeds not creeds" that was his motto.

But instead they'd been sent a young preacher in his early twenties and not long out of training. He might well be popular with students, but what did he know about leading a progressive city centre church like theirs?

Worst still they'd heard he had some rather outdated views about the bible being the word of God and Jesus the only way of salvation. The staff team were most concerned.

The best they could hope for was that the young man would learn to 'get with the porgram'. Perhaps, he'd be smart enough to let them mould him into the kind of minister a modern church like there's really needed.

But it wasn't to be. The young minister quickly developed a reputation not only for his down-to-earth preaching style but also his uncompromising commitment to scripture and the clear preaching of the gospel.

Something which made him particularly popular with students and young people in the city.

Horrorified that their progressive congregation might get a reputation as a 'evangelical student church' the congregation staged a mutity.

First, They sent a petition with over 100 signatures to the bishop.

When that was ignored they barricaded the pews. But the young minister just put chairs down the aisle.

When the church warden hide the chairs (probably citing health and safety violations); the students stood instead.

And when one Sunday the young preacher arrived only to find himself locked out of his own church, he simply took the students back to the vicarage and held the service in his lounge.

The year was 1782 and the preachers name was Charles Simeon. Simeon would go on to be one of the most influential church leaders of his time. Most of his early ministry was spent dealing with opposition from a congregation which was hostile to the gospel.

We might not be able to relate exactly to Charles Simeons experience's - I doubt we'll come back next week to find the doors locked and bolted - but I'm sure some of us can relate to the kinds of pressures he faced.

What Charles Simeon faced when we went to church on a Sunday morning - opposition, shame, pressure to compromises, and exclusion - might be what some of face when we leave church on a sunday and head to our workplaces, colleges, the school gates, even to our own homes.

But it might not be. Perhaps you are speaking up for Christ and find that far from being mocked people are actually eager to hear. That's certainly been my expirence in recent months.

Perhaps you've never faced oposition because you've never spoken out for Christ. What then?

What do we do with a passage 1 Peter 4:12-19?

Well, this morning, we're going to see that whatever our situition. Peter wants us to be "Be Prepared" to be opposed for our faith when the time comes.

Surprisingly, he is going to do that, by showing us how **God will use persecution for our good.**

[Repeat]

Peter gives us three examples of how God uses Persecution for our good. Here they are:

1.  Persecution increases our joy (v12-13)
2.  Persecution builds our confidence (v14-16)
3.  Persecution strengthens our perseverance (v17-19)

[Repeat]

## 1.  Persecution increases our joy (v12-13)

Firstly, Persecution increases our joy (v12-13)

Charles Simeon's story is a great one. But when you read that he was often described as one of the most joyful men anyone could ever meet, it can easily be a discouraging one too.

How did he manage that? After all, our culture seems to say: if you want a good life you need to go with the grain of society, not against it!

Maybe this kind of joy is only for historical heroes, like Charles Simeon...

Or is it?

It seems to me that, if we take today's passage at face value, then joy in opposition, can actually be part of the everyday experience of everday Christian's like you and me.

The key to experiencing this joy is found in v12-13. Let's start at v12.

**Dear friends, do not be surprised at the painful trial you are suffering, as though something strange were happening to you.**

The first thing we see is that opposition to the gospel should not surprise us.

In other words, we can ask God how to respond to opposition, what to say, how to live in a world that opposes us, but the one thing we're not to ask is 'why is this happening to me?' We're to expect it frmo time to time.

Having walked through this letter Peter's advice makes sense. Hasn't he been preparing us for this over the previous chapters?

The word 'suffering', it is various forms, appears 9 times in chapters 1-4. 4 times he talks about Christian's being insulted or falsely accusesd. And three times he presents Jesus as a model of how to suffer persecution well.

It is as if he is saying throughout this letter that the more we think about Jesus death on the cross for our sins, the more prepared we'll be to carry our own cross in service of of our savour.

The more we think about Jesus suffering for us; the more willing we will be to suffer for him when the time comes.

It's like Peter wants to ensure that we have the right tools in our kit bag. So that when we face opposition, like the old scout motto says, we'll 'be prepared'.

Ok, you might be thinking. 'Liam, I'm with you on being prepared to face opposition for what I believe. I don't like the idea, but what your saying makes sense.'

'But joyful in persecution? Come on? Really?'

Take a look at v13.

**"But rejoice that you participate in the sufferings of Christ, so that you may be overjoyed when his glory is revealed."**

To participate in the sufferings of Christ is, simply, to experience the same kinds of oppositon that Jesus faced in his earthly ministry.

It is to be misunderstood, misrepresented, and mistreated whilst trying to live the good life God has for us in pagan and hostile world.

Peter says that when we face that kind of opposition we are to be glad, thankful, even to rejoice and praise God.

Amazingly though, Peter says that how we respond to suffering for Jesus now has a direct impact on how we'll respond when Jesus returns. If we gladly endure opposition for being a Christian now then we'll be overjoyed when Jesus' returns.

> In J. R. R. Tolkein's _The Lord of the Rings_, the two main characters Sam and Frodo spend most of the book thinking that their the friend Gandalf died trying to protect them.
>
> It is only at the very end of the book they discover that Gandalf is still alive... He's how the reunion is described. Listen to this: Sam speaks first.
>
> “Gandalf! I thought you were dead! But then I thought I was dead myself. Is everything sad going to come untrue? What's happened to the world?"
>
> "A great Shadow has departed," said Gandalf, and then he laughed and the sound was like music, or like water in a parched land; and as he listened the thought came to Sam that he had not heard laughter, the pure sound of merriment, for days upon days without count.”

Did you catch that, Tolkien tells us that Sam's joy at being reunited with his old friend is greater for having endured pain and hardship in the lead up to their reunion.

I wonder what joy and comfort Same would have had if he'd known all along, with certain hope, that he's old friend was waiting for him at the end of the journey?

In a simiar way, Peter says, we gladly endure suffering for Christ now, delighting in God inspire of it, because of the greater joy that awaits us when Jesus returns.

Its not that the this joy makes the pain and difficulty go away, but it does bring comfort and lifts our eyes to day we united with Jesus finally and forever.

Those who oppose the gospel want discourage us to the point where we either give up entirely or feel too ashamed to speak up. But In God's staggering love for us he uses persecution to increase our delight in Christ.

The challenge is, that to rejoice in suffering for the gospel, many of us, myself included, first need to repent of our lack of joy generally.

We need to remember that Christian joy comes from reflecting on what Jesus has done for us.

If we want to be joyful, especially in times of persecution, we need to hear the gospel reguarly, read about it daily, and pray it into our hearts constantly so that our _feeling_ not just our thinking and acting can be conformed to image of Christ.

As Hebrews 12:1-3 describes, the same Jesus "who for the _joy_ set before him endured the cross, scorning its shame."

Endure persecution because it increases our joy.

## 2. Persecution because it leads to perseverance (14-16)

Secondly, Persecution builds our confidence (14-16)

This might surpsise you but as a child I was not that great at physical activities. Shocking... I know! I wasn't on any sports teams, but I was a cub scout. I never earnt many badges but I loved the meetings and especially the challenge camp.

Challenge camp was when all the cub scout troops in our area came together and competed in challenges against one another.

I was alright at the obstacle course. Other were quicker than me on climbing wall. And I really stunk at archery and air rifles. No really. I was terrible.

Our team didn't do well overall, but I still got my challenge camp badge at the end of the weekend.

Now when I went to Cubs that next week, with my challenge camp badge sown on my jumper. Do you think I was more confident in my scouting or less confident?

I was more confident, even though I hadn't done well at camp, I still completed all the challenges. And I had grown in confidence that cubs scouts was for me.

In these next verses Peter is going to show us that rather than discouraging us, the oppoition we face sharing are faith is supposed to build our confidence not ruin it. This is another way God uses persecution for our good.

Take a look at v15.

**If you are ridiculed for the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you**

I'm going to go out on a limb here and guess that most of us don't see being mocked for our faith as a blessing.

But Peter says that when we face opposition because of our way of life we are blessed because it actually provides us with evidence that our commitment to Christ is genuine and true.

Romans 10:9 is clear that

**"If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved."**

But how can we know that our if we've truly done that? How can we be confident that we're not simply decieving ourselves? Well the New Testament gives us a number of ways. And, I've listed some for your in the notes.

And Peter describes one of those ways in this verse. When we face hostile oppostion for our beliefs and endure it, its evidence that the Holy Spirit is at work in our lives. It is evidence that our faith is genuine.

Being mocked for our faith isn't a blessing because the Lord is some kind of trickster wanting us to believe that evil is good and good is evil. But because in his love and power, he can even use harsh words and snide comments for our good.

Our opponents seek to use words shame us into silence but our loving heveanly father takes those words and turns them into bricks which reinforce the foundations of our faith.

So that rather than giving up, we glorify God that our opponents see enough of christ in our words, our character, and our actions that they are not only rejecting us; they're rejecting the see Jesus in us and in our message.

But Peter has a warning for us too. Look at verses 15-16:

**If you suffer, it should not be as a murderer or thief or any other kind of criminal, or even as a meddler. However, if you suffer as a Christian, do not be ashamed, but praise God that you bear that name.**

Peter's point is this. God will only use the insults that come at us for living differently from our society.

If we are insulted because we worse than those around us or because we're always poking our nose in other people business. Then that won't increase confidence that you have genuine faith.

If anything it is cause for serious soul searching and prayerful repentence.

Now again this doesn't mean that if we fail to speak up, avoid an opportunity to share the gospel, or even deny Jesus when under social pressure we can't be a genuine Christian.

Even Peter denied Jesus three times rather than risk dying along side him. Peer pressure is powerful weapon when used against us. After all, we all like to be liked and we all want to fit in rather than stand out.

But if we face opposition because our lives display Jesus to such an extent that people don't like it and tell us so. Well, that is no reasons to be ashamed, Peter says, it is a reason to praise God that people recognise that you belong to Christ and that the Holy SPirit is at work in your life.

Which is exactly how God use persecution build our confidence.

## 3. Persecution fuels our perseverance (17-19)

Finally, persecution fuels our perseverance (v17-19)

Discipline. I wonder what comes to mind when you hear the word discipline. What you think about it is likely affected by a number of things.

Firstly your age.

If you are over thirty there is a good chance you see discipline largely as a good thing. Something a person form character and find their a palce in the community.

If you are under thirty your more likely to think that discipline is a more negative thing. Something unloving and restrictive. A last resort to get someone to do what you want.

Another thing which could affect your view of discipline is how your parents disciplined you.

If you feel that they were fair, compassionate, and reassured you that what they were doing was out of love and for your good. Even if you didn't always agree with their actions or their methods, you're more likely to see discipline positively,

IF you look back and feel your parents were harsh, or disproportional in how they handed out displcine. Then you may well see it more as a bad thing.

OF course other things play a part to: education level, experience, ethnicity, country of birth, and Christian maturity. A lot goes into how we view that one little word.

But it is important that we recognise any baggage we might be carrying about the word 'discipline', beucase if don't we are going to struggle to see what Peter says next as a good thing.

v17.

**"For the time has come for judgment to begin with God’s household"**

What on earth does that mean?

Many of us would read Peter's words and think, "I thought that being a Christian meant I wouldn't have to face judgement?" Others might says "I thought the judgement was later? When Jesus returned?"

Well to understand what Peter is saying let's back up for moment.

Firstly, you're right.

Christian's will escape the final judgement. As Peter has already said back in v13, when Jesus returns ours will be overwhelming joy at seeing God's purposes come to completion.

Joy is what awaits those who trust in Christ, not a just legal sentence that results in us being confined to hell.

But the final judgement is more than just a giant court room where every wrong is righted, and every sinful action called to account. There is also a purifying element to that judgemeant, where, as God makes all things new he pruges that new creation of everything that is not good, right, and perfect.

For the non-Chrisitian that means unless they turn to Christ, there is no place for them God's new Creation.

The hard truth is that in the final judgement they will be removed as God remakes the Universe.

That's the point Peter is making in v17-18.

But this idea of a purfying judgement isn't unique to Peter, it pops in the Old Testameant as early as Genesis 3 as Adam and Eve are cast out of the Garden of Eden, and it pops up at the end of the bible in Rev 21:7-8. Where King Jesus lists all those who moral rebellion means that they will have no place in his New Creation kingdom.

Its sobering stuff.

But Christians, are New Creation people. Paul puts it this way in 2 Corinthians 5:17: **Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, [they are] a new creation; the old has gone, the new has come!**

In other words, as a person comes to faith in Christ the new creation burst into this world as they are pass from being spiritually dead and doomed to hell to being spiritually alive and destined for eternity with God.

So whilst we have escaped hell and have a place in the New Creation, there is still purifying that needs to happen in our lives. We need to be placed under the judgement, or scrutiny of God's holiness so that he can lovingly discipline us and refine our character. And that is what Peter is talking about here. Persecution as discipline.

In God's love and kindness he uses the persecution we face as a way to lovingly break our attraction to sin and the idols of this world.

I think it is really important to see that Peter doesn't make any one-to-one links between specific sins and the opposition we face. The discipline-judgement that Peter talks about here describes the general way God uses persecution. But it is a general principle with a specific application.

Take a look at  v19 **So then, those who suffer according to God’s will should commit themselves to their faithful Creator and continue to do good.**

Like all good parental discipline, God's use of persecution is as much about encouraging good characteristics in our lives as it is discouraging the bad ones.

Peter's application of God's discipline through persectutuon does not lead to guilt ('God's punishing me'), but godliness ('God will use this to help me grow!'). And he has one particular quality of godliness in mind: perseverance! following Jesus no matter what. That's what perserevence means - following Jesus no matter what.

The incredible thing about v17-19 is this: Far from driving us away God, the Lord uses persectutuon and opposition to drive us to him in dependant perseverance. Rather than causing us to give up, it makes us more resolved to pursue our Heavenly Father and the good life he has for us.

Our oppoenants use their words and actions to silence us or make us give up, but God in his grace uses it for our good.

Endure persecution because it fuels our perseverance.

## Conclusion: What About Charles Simeon? What about you?

In many ways, Charles Simeon's life is an 18th Century case study on 1 Peter 4:12-19.

It took reflecting on the Jesus cruxificion one merseable day in Cambridge for him to realise that opposition for bring a follower of Christ was something to expected from time to time.

It wasn't that he should go looking for it, but he wasn't surprised when it came along.

MOre than that, he came to see it as a way for God's grace to be at work in his life so that he would continue to pursue the Good life good had for him with joy, confidence, and maturing character.

Reflecting on that day, he wrote in his journal that "I henceforth bound persecution as a wreath of glory round my brow."

And that is exactly how he lived.

Eventually his rentless gospel preaching, his joy, his confidence, and his character was used by the Holy Spirit to melt the hard hearts of Holy Trinity, Cambridge.

And by the end of his life, he had inspired a generation of gospel preachers and missionaries.

We live in an age when more and more we find ourselves a minority in our homes, our communities, and our workplaces. And increasingly, an opposed one at that.

But that opposition is not ment to silence, discourage, or cause us to give up. God's intention is to turn that evil to his glory through our good.

He does that by making opposition and persecution aid us in the pursuit of God's good life.

So that like Charles Simeon we would know joy in Christ, a growing confidence that we belong to Christ, and character that is increasingly becoming more like Christ... come what may.

Let's pray.
