# Uncover John Study Questions

## Study A: A Sign of What's Coming

### Introduction
_In his book **The Last Word**, author Thomas Nagal writes, 'I want atheism to be true, and I am made uneasy by the fact that some of the most intelligent and well informed people I know are religious believers. It isn't just that I don't believe in God, and naturally, hoppe that I'm right in my belief. It is that I hope there is no God. I don't want there to be a God, I don't that the universe to be like that.'_

**Why might someone 'hope there is no God'?**

**Read: John 20:30-31 (pg, 118)**

**1/. What reason does John give for writing his biography of Jesus?**

**2/. John makes the identity of Jesus a major theme of his book. Who do you think might have been? How did you come to this conclusion?**

_In ancient Jewish thought the, the Christ or Messiah was a promised leader of the Jewish nation, who defeat the nation's enemies and lead the people an era of peace and properity._

#### Historical Context
> The first public encounter that John presents us with with is Jesus at a wedding with friends and family. Weddings in the first-century even more significant and lavish affairs than they are today. Marriage meant more than the joining of two individuals. A wedding markde the bride and groom's entrance into their community as adults. The celebrations usually lasted for at least a week. It was the responsibility of the groom to provide all the was necessary for such a hughely important social occasion.

**Read John 2:1-11**

**3/. The wedding has run out of wine. How might the bride and groom feel if there was no more wine at the wedding feast, especially in a shame/honour culture?**

**4/. If the wine was finished, what would the wedding crowd conclude about the groom in particular? What might the birde's family think about their new son-in-law?**

_In the Hebrew Bible, wine represented joy, so its absence at a wedding would be disastrous. Jesus' reply to his mother isn't as stark as it first looks, but it is quite puzzling, especially wehen he says, 'My hour has not yet come' in verse 4. Jesus seems to be a man who knows his destiny and sees his whole life as heading towards a particular moment._

**5/. Although Jesus is reluctant to step into the limelight at this point, why do you he does something quite miraculous to help the couple?**

**6/. Each of the six stone water jars would contain 80-120 Litres (~170-250 pints), the equivalent of 700-1,000 bottles, or 4,200-6,000 glasses of wine. Describe the master of the banquet's impression of the wine? How will this wine change the party?**

_NB: Wine was always cut with water in the Jewish world at a ratio of 1 parts wine to 3 parts water, sometimes more diluted that that._

**7/. What does the mater of the banquet conclude about the groom? Does the groom deserve the credit? How would the bride and groom feel about what Jesus has done for them?**

**8/. The water jars contained water for ceremonial washing. Before each meal Jews would wash, as a symbol of washing away their sins before receiving what God had given them. Thus the water in the jars was a continual reminder of their guilt and need for cleansing. Given this background, what might be the significance of Jesus turning this water into the most beautiful wine?**

_Jesus quietly rescued a wedding and saved a desperate couple from disgrace. But his disciples (or followers) saw the that his actions pointed to something far more significant about him. They would be familiar with an ancient Hebrew texts (the Old Testament) such as the following from the prophet Isaiah (c. 700BC):_

> 6 On this mountaing the Lord Almighty will prepare a feasth of rich food for all peoples, a banquet of aged wine— the best of meats and the finest of wines. 7 On this mountain he will destroy the shroud that enfolds all peoples, the sheet that covers all nations; 8	he will swallow up death forever. The Sovereign Lord will wipe away the tears from all faces; he will remove his people’s disgrace from all the earth. The Lord has spoken.

## Study B: Do You Come Here Often?

### Introduction
_'Resign yourelef to the lifelong sadness tht comes from never being satified.' Like many people, successful author Zadie Smith has found satisfaction elusive._

**Do you think it is possible to find lasting satisfaction, and if so, how?**

| Read:  | John 4:4-42 (pg, 18)       |

### Historical Context
> IN this encounter, Jesus does something that in his day would have been considered shocking. He speaks to a Samaritan woman. This might not sound like much, but in his culure, a religious man would never consider speaking to a women in pblic. An ancient {Jewish} text (Sirach 43:12) said, 'better is the wickedness of a man than a women who does good; it is woman who brings shame and disgrace.' Jesus also ignores the deep racial and religious prejudice that Jews felt towards Samaritans. Jews considered Samaritans 'heretics' because that combined some Jewish teachings with pagan practices.
>
> We join Jesus at noon (the sixth hour, as it was the custom to count the hour from sunrise), in the sweltering midday heat, when he is tired and thirsty.

**Read John 4:4-15**

**1/. It was the custom for women to go together to the well to draw water in the cool of the morning. Why might this woman be drawing water alone and in the heat of the day?**

**2/. Why is she so surprised that Jesus asks her for a drink?**

**3/. How does Jesus describe the 'living water' he offers? What does Jesus mean when he uses the words 'thirst' and 'thirsty' in v13?**

**4/. How do you think the woman is responding to what Jesus claims to offer? Is her request in verse 15 serious or cynical?**

**Read John 4:16-26**

**5/. Jesus unexpectedly moves the conversation on to the subject of the women's relationships. Why do you think she responds with less than the truth in v17?**

**6/. How might her past relationships explain why she went to the well alone at noon and not with the other women in the morning?**

**7/. Why do you think Jesus exposes the reality of her past relationships? How will this help her find living water and satisfaction for her thirt?**

_Unsettled by his insight into her life, the woman starts to recognise that Jesus is at very least a prophet. Her comments in v20 are not a change of subject; rather she is asking which temple she should go to in order to find forgiveness and be restored to God._

_Jesus responds in v21-24 by saying that his coming into the world changes everything. People will no longer need to go somewhere to find forgiveness and worship God because his coming means people can know God personally and intimately, as 'Father' ('worship in the Spirit'). Nor will there be any confusion about where the truth lies because in his coming Jesus reveals the truth about God. Later in the Gospel Jesus describes himself as 'truth' (John 14:6)_

**Read John 4:27-29, 39-42**

**8/. Describe the reaction of the disciples when they return to the well in v27. Why do they react in this way?**

**9/. given all the we know about this women, what strikes you as so surprising about her actions and words in v28-29? How do you think she feels now? Why?**

**10/. According to verses 39-42, what do the people of the come to believe, and what persuades them?**

11/. Reflection on the whole chapter, what is the living what that Jesus claims to bring? If he is the 'Saviour of the world' what has he come to save people from?

### What does this mean for us?
> Jesus locates out emptiness or 'thirst' in our alienation from God. He promises to bring us into an intimate relationship with God as Father, which will completely satisfy our thirst.
>
> A sense of emptiness is a common human experience. Rock star and humanitarian Bob Geldof was once asked whether he had found satisfaction. 'Not at all. I don't know what that would mean. I am unfulfilled as a human being. Otherwise, why are the large holes here {thumping his chest}? Everything, I do is because I know that is down in those holes. I am frightened of it; it makes me depresed.'
>
> Do you respond to what Bob Geldof says? Where do we tend to look for satisfaction? Are you optimistic or cynical about the possibility of lasting fulfillment?

_"You awaken us to delight in your praise; for you made us for yourself, and our heart is restless until it rests in you."_ ~ Augstine of Hippo, _The Confessions_

_"The chief end of man {the reason humans exist} is to glorfy God and enjoy him forever"_ ~ _The Westminster Shorter Catechism_

## Blind Faith

### Introduction
_According biologist Richard Dawkins, 'Faith is the great cop-out, the great excuse to evade the need to think and evaluate evidence. Faith is belief in spite of, even perhaps because of, the lack of evidence.'_

**Do you agree that Christians believe without evidence? Is the Christian faith irrational?**

### Historical Context
> Opinions about Jesus are becoming sharply divided. Is he from God or is he a deluded troublemaker? The Pharisees, strict adherents of the Jewish religious law, are angry with him. In their view, Jesus doesn't keep the Sabbath, a day on which Jews are meant to refrain from any form of work in order to worship. But Jesus heals someone on the Sabbath, which, according to their traditions, was a break with the Sabbath regulations. They are so angry with Jesus that in the previous chpater they tried to murder him.
>
> In this encounter, Jesus rejects the popular notion that a man's blindness is the result of his own or his parents' sin. Jesus heals the man on the Sabbath and is once again embroiled in controversy.

**Read John 9:1-8**

**1/. Describe what life would be like for someone born blind - pracitically, socially, emotionally, etc.** _Note the hints in verses 1 & 8_

**2/. How might the man have felt as he walked to the pool? What might he have been thinking as he came back to the where he was once forced to beg?**

**3/. How does this miracle relate to Jesus' caliming to be the 'light of the world'? What does it suggest about the life Jesus claims to offer?**

_Thoughout his writing, John uses light primarily as a symbol of life, while darkness is symbolic of sin and death. This miracle depicts in actions what Jesus has come to do for the world, Jesus claims to have come to rescue people from the darkness of sin and death and to give them eternal life._

**Read John 9:8-23**

**4/. Why do you think the man's neighbours respond as they do? Why do they take him to the Pharisees in v8-13?**

**5/. The Pharisees now enter the scene. Why can't they agree about what has happened, despite the clear testimony of the man? Read verses 13-17. What assumptions are guiding their conclusions?**

**6/. Why are the man's parents now brought in? How do they respond, and why, in v18-23?**

**Read John 9:24-34**

**7/. Why do you think the Pharisees react as they do to the man's testimony? Are they interested in the truth? What 'truth' migh they want the man to confess?**

**8/. How does the man respond to the accusations and insults of the Pharisees? What point does he make in v30-33? Why do you think the Pharisees respond as they do in v34?**

**Read John 9:35-41**

**9/. Why do you think Jesus seeks out the man?**

Cf. _"Though father and mother forsake me, the LORD will receive me."_ ~ Ps 27:10

**10/. In the last few hours, this man has experienced a radical re-evaluation of who he thinks Jesus is. How has his opinion changed in v11, 17, and 38, and what conclusion has he reached about Jesus' identity?**

_For the first time in this encounter the man see Jesus with physical eyes and worships him. The man's journey from blindness to sigh parallels his spiritual journey as he follows the evidence and comes to see who Jesus truly is. The term 'Son of Man' could just refer to another human being, but the Hebrew scriptures use the term to describe a person with God-like characteristics._

**11/. This encounter begins with the assumption that the blind man is sinful. It ends in an incredibly unexpected way, with Jesus describing the Pharisees in this manner. What are they guilty of? What keeps them from accepting the conclusion to the evidence points?**

### What does it mean for us?
> Jesus makes bold claims about himself in this passage. In claiming to be the 'light of the world' he insists that we are all in darkness without him. In the Hebrew Bible, worship is reserved for God alone, so by receiving the man's worship, Jesus has equated himself with God.
>
> Oxford academic and author CS Lewis wrote about Jesus: 'You can shut him up as a fool, you can spit on him and kill him as a demon; or you can fall at his feet and call him Lord and God. But you let us not come up with patronising nonsense about him being a great human teacher. He has not left that open to us. He didn't intend to.'
>
> Why do you think people are more comfortable thinking about Jesus as a great teacher, close their eyes to the kinds of claims he makes about himself in this encounter?
