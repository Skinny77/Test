## Introduction

<!-- TODO Change to phobias introduction -->

<!-- When it comes to human relationships we're all different aren't we? Sure, their are some ways we can slice and dice things: What we look for in a friend or a spouse; whether we are fundamentally an introvert or an extrovert or somewhere in between; cat person or dog person. But even then we'd be different in the make up of the preferences, and their priorities.

There is though, one thing that we all share. One fundamental characteristic of human relationships that unintes us all. We all want to be accepted; we all fear being rejected. -->

Think about it. It is universal isn't it? We all wanted be accepted, we all like being liked. We all desire a person or a place where we feel that we can be ourselvs, somewhere we can drop our barriers without fear of being pushed away, shamed, or unfairly judged. Whether a friend or friendship group, a parent, or a spouse, when we've found it, if we are lucky enough to discover it, we treasure it.

Yet sometimes something holds us back in our quest for acceptance doesn't it? A dark concern, a haunting worry. I'm talking about the universal fear of rejection. We've all felt it, haven't we. It's what stopped us talking to person we fancied in school. It is the same thing that prevented us apply for that job really wanted, or the painful feeling we expirenced when we did get it. It is the hurt travels with redundancy letters. The ache of a parent we've never known, and hot fire left by a cheating spouse.

But what if the fear and longing point towards a deep, more basic longing a fear that exists within all of us. What if under it all it reveals the knowledge that we know there is a great something behind the universe, maybe even a creator God, maybe even a Father God who desires to know us and be known by us. One whose acceptance or rejection of us could even shape our eternity and redefine our lives!

This evening, we explore the final moments of Jesus life; the life of man who knew acceptance and rejection like no other. And as we do, we are going to discover that **if we want be accepted by God, we need to trust in the one rejected by God** {Repeat}

To help us see why that is, we are going to zoom in on a two sections of Matthew 27. And as we do, we'll answer these questions:

1.  Why are our lives unacceptable to God? (Matthew 27:11-26)
2.  Why did Jesus have to be rejected by God? (Matthew 27:45-51)

So have your bible's open at Matthew 27, page 998 in red bibles.

## Why are our lives unacceptable to God?

So let's start with our first question, why are our lives unacceptable to God?

Film and fiction are filled with stories of painful rejection aren't they? Think about it for a moment: There's Edmund in the Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe; Gollum in the Lord of the Rings, Londo Calrisian in The Empire Strikes Back, Lots-o-Hugging Bear in Toy Story 3. Break ups, backstabs, betrayals they're everywhere in popular culture. Because they are part of life in our dying world.

Anyone familiar with Jesus life will know that by the time he stands before Pilate, Jesus too has had his fair share of shocking betrayal and painful rejection. Only a chapter earlier, Judas, one of Jesus disciples had betrayed him and lead him into the hands the religious authorities. Then hours later, Peter rejects Jesus publicly, denying three times that he even knew the man that Peter had once promised to die for, rather than deny.

But before the events of chapter 27 are over, Jesus will experience rejection two more times. One publicly infront of a crowd; the second privately on the cross. To understand the significance of the first, we need to understand some of the players in this tragedy.

**The first group of players are the chief priests.** Petty and jealous we know from chapter 26:57-66 that after a shame trial they eventually sentence Jesus to death on trumpt up charges of blasphamy. We later learn in Matthew 27:18 that it's envy of Jesus popularity that is ultimately driving their desire to see him killed. But even their ability to that is a shame. Since the Roman takeover in 63 BC the Jewish ruling council no longer had the right to sentence people to death without the Roman Governor signing off on it. So in v11 they bring Jesus to Pilate, and hope to use the governor as a tool to their own evil ends.

Pilate is next to appear on stage. Verses 11-26 make us realise that Pilate was not a man interested in truth or justice; by offering the crowd a the choice between Jesus and the criminal Barabbas, it gives him the chance to make some polic capital. If all goes to plan he'll appear a kind and gracious governoer. Better still, if the crowd choose Jesus Pilate, also has the chance to score one up on the religious leaders by publicly embarrassing them.

Pilate was playing politics with an innocent mans life. Jesus was a piece to be played, a chip to be gambled. So Pilate places his bet, he rolls the dice.... and losses. Even after being warned by his wife... a lesson for husbands everywhere.

By v24, Pilate realises that his plan is going knowhere,so he washes his hands in front of the crowd, a cowardly and sulky attempt to spare himself any guilt for his failed political manouverings.

The crowd, come last in the cast list. Last Sunday, John walked us through Matthew 21, where in the opening verses the crowds of pilgrims descend on Jeruslam shouting and sining and waving palm banches as Jesus donkey comes past. Whenever I read that passage I have expect Matthew to tell us the crowd ask Jesus to sign their copies of the Torah for them.

Now five days later, that same crowd are gathered outside the palace. Only this time that same crowd mentality is pointed towards Jesus with hate and loathing. The palm brances are gone, the only thing their waving in the air now are angry fists. Certainly, we're told in v20 the crowds choice was greatly influenced by the chief priests stirring them into a frenzy.

But, in v24-25, when Pilate shows his contempt for their decision the crowd are more than happy to take responsibility not only for Barabbas' realise - a man described in v16 as a notorious criminal, and in Mark 15:6 as a terrorist and murderer. But also for the death of Jesus, a man innocent of any crime and the victim of history's worst miscarriage of justice. The verses that follow describe Jesus being sentenced and handed over to the Roman Soilders to flogged, mocked, beaten, and spat upon.

So far in this section, Matthew has described to us three groups of the people: The chief priests, Pontious Pilate, and the gathered crowd. And he has describe Jesus painful and public rejction before the crowds. But what do any of them have to do with our first questions? How did this characters help us understand 'Why our lives are unacceptable to God?'

You see the each of the four gospel writers - Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, each go to great lengths to describe these events in some detail. Why is that? Certainly, they are presenting the evidence for the innocence of Jesus, that he was unfairly tried, wrongly condemned, and unlawfully killed. But what is something more is going on here?

The events from Jesus arrest in the Garden of Gethsemane up until the his sentencing and crucifixion provide a shocking window into how fallen humanity naturally respond to God. Remember, at the centre all of this scheming, deceving, rejecting, betraying, political manuvouring, and mockery is not a nice bloke who did some nice things for people in bottom runs of society. This is happening to the creator of the universe, the Lord of Heaven and Earth, God the Son in Human form..

The truth is that our lives are unacceptable to God because in our hearts we are by nature no different to Judas, Peter, the religious leaders, pilate, the crowd, or the roman solders.

Left to our own devicies, like Judas, we'll gladly pass Jesus up for financial gain or forbidden pleasures. Then when its all over, be more concerned about calming our guilty conscience than our afornt to a holy God.

Like Peter, when social pressure get the better us, we're quick to deny that we even know Jesus at all. We might not go as far as publicly denying him, but often our silence in conversation with friends and family is just as condemning.

The chief priest are motivated by envy and pride. And like them we too grumble when we think someone has displaced us in the social ladder, or within the church we bicker and squabble over scraps of glory that don't even belong to us!

Like Pilate somer try to keep there options open. We play the field, because we recognise that we might be able to use Jesus or his followers to get what we want. So we resist committing, to coming down on one side or the other. We hedge our bets, even against the warnings of others, because we think we can play the odds and win.

If you need anymore more proof that these verses are a mirror that reflect the darkness of every human heart, my hearth, your heart, let me ask you a question. Having heard that list, was your first reaction to say, 'Yes, just that's me' or was it to try to think of excuse your behaviour and theres?

In his famous book, _The Cross of Christ_, John Stott writes,

> "“Were you there when they crucified my Lord?” the old negro spiritual asks. And we must answer, “Yes, we were there.” Not as spectators only, but as participants, guilty participants, plotting, scheming, betraying, bargaining and handing him over to be crucified.
>
> We may try to wash our hands of responsibility like Pilate. But our attempt will be as futile as his. For there is blood on our hands. Before we can begin to see the cross as something done for us (leading us to faith and worship), we have to see it as something done by us (leading us to repentance)."

Our lives are unacceptable to God because left to our own devices we want nothing to do with him or his Son. Or worse we try to tame him, to cage, and use for our ends.

But there is hope for us. Because if we want a life that is acceptable to God, we need to trust in the one rejected by God, and that is what we'll look at next.

## Why did Jesus have to be rejected by God?

So why did Jesus have to be rejected by God? That's what'll think about now as we consider Jesus final moments on the cross.

A few weeks ago, Abi and I finished a series on Amazon Prime called _The Flash_. The series is based around the DC comic book hero of the same name, and it follows the story of a young man named Barry Allan. Barry Alan is a Crime Scene Investigator and one day he is struck by lightning which gives him the ability to run at superspeed. So what does Barry do with these new found powers? Isn't it obvious, he puts a red spandex suit and fights crime!

Anyway in the final series Barry runs so fast that he actually travels into the future. And whilst he is there he witnesses the murder of his fiance, Iris West. the episodes that follow show barry and his friends battling to change fate, to change the future, as week-by-week Iris' death seems more and more inevitble.

Reading the gospel accounts of Jesus' life you might be forgiven for thinking that Jesus is the victim of some bizarre mishap of history. A Gallieen preacher, who, ok made some bold claims, but for the most part was greatly misunderstood and unfairly secntence to death. The only problem is that Jesus does not leave this option open to us. As early as Luke 9:21, Jesus tells his disciples that he "must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, the chief priests and the teachers of the law, and he must be killed and on the third day be raised to life."

Jesus doesn't walk into the events of Matthew 27 unaware of what lies around the corner. Neither, like the characters in the Flash, do we see we Jesus constantly battling and scrabbling for a way to escape his fate. That is because Jesus knew what he was walking into; The Father, Jesus the Son, and the Holy Spirit had planned this out from eternity past. So what is it that Jesus is walking into? His certain death for one, but also something far worse.

Let's remind ourlseves of those final moments in Matthew 27:45-51.

> "From noon until three in the afternoon darkness came over all the land. About three in the afternoon Jesus cried out in a loud voice, “Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?” (which means “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”).
>
> When some of those standing there heard this, they said, “He’s calling Elijah.” Immediately one of them ran and got a sponge. He filled it with wine vinegar, put it on a staff, and offered it to Jesus to drink. The rest said, “Now leave him alone. Let’s see if Elijah comes to save him.”

The events that Jesus walks calmly and boldy into is not simply his own painful death on a roman cross, but also his outright rejection by his father. The other new testament writers make this clearer in their letters, but it is here too in Matthew 27 if we only scratch below the surface. Let's walk through someone of these verse and I show you want I mean.

The first thing we read in v45 for three hours, from about midday to about 3pm, darkness covers land. At a time when the Middle-Eastern sun would have been at its strongest, the day bacame like night time. In the ancient world, natural events and disaster were often seen God's judgement. Think about Ex 10 for example, there God brings the Plague of Darkness on the Egyptians as a judgement for keeping his people in slavery. And Amos 8:9-10 says, "“In that day,” declares the Sovereign LORD, “I will make the sun go down at noon and darken the earth in broad daylight... I will make that time like mourning for an only son and the end of it like a bitter day."

So here in Jesus final moments, the Father is present as a judge ready to pass sentence. But sentence on whom? Perhaps the women and the other followers of Jesus watching from a distance hope that this was the final rescue. That God would pour out his judgement on those who had acted so wicked towards the Son that he loved, that now Jesus would come down from the cross victorious and lead Isael to freedom and prosperity.

Certainly, the darkness warns of judgement on Israel and Roman for what they have done to God's one and only son. But only in as far as it is a warning of judgement to all humanity. As we've already seen, no one, no human being is innocent when it comes to death of Jesus. All us stand accused, all of us stand condemned, and all of us rightly deserve God's judgement for our rejection of his son, Jesus.

But what is more surprising is where that judgement is directed. After three hours of darkness Jesus finally cries out in v46, quoting, Psalm 22:1 "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" For three hours, The Father's justice and wrath against human sin and wicked was poured out. Not on those who had conspired to see Jesus crucified, nor on us for the part we played in it. But on his Son, his only prefect and sinless, son, Jesus.

Jesus cry, is the cry of man rejected and alone in the final moments of his life. But worse than than, it is the cry of the God's son mysterious and painful cut off from his Father for the first time. In that moment, a relationship that has existed for all etnerity with greater depth of love and intimacy than any human relationship will ever know was broken. Jesus was rejected.

Having expirenced this rejection, and the final mockery of the onlookers in v47-49, only then does Jesus finally gives up his spirit and die. But for what? Why the rejection? Why the suffering? Why such a violent end for the Son of God? The answer is the one that we began - **Jesus was rejected, so that we could accepted.**

Jesus died so that we could live, he was cut off, so we could be welcomed in, he was rejected so that we could be accepted. Make no mistake, God is love, but is also Holy. And a holy God cannot be in the presnce of sinful people without expressing his judgement and justice on that sin. Our lives our in and of themselves are unacceptable to God because left to ourselves we neither desire to know God nor submit ourselves to his rule. At best we exchange him for an idol, a poor imitation that suits us better.

Not only our we unacceptable, we are incapable of making ourselves acceptable to God. We make appeals to his love, his kindness, his goodness, or compassion hoping against hope that he'll let us off the hook for our sin. Forgetting Paul's words in Romans 2:4, "that God’s kindness is intended to lead {us} to repentance."

So we have a problem don't we? Natturaly, we are unacceptable, with no way of making ourselves acceptable. In ourslves are not right with God, we are condemn us unrightouess. We need a righteousness that is not our own, but what about our sin? Even if we could live perfectly from until end of our days that would not not make ammends for our past crimes. The plate is broken, whether cracked or smashed, no amount of glue and celotape will change that. We don't only need a righteousness that of our own, we need someone to take our place on death row. We need a substitute.

These verses in Matthew 27 reveal one of the most profound and amazing truths of Christian. That on the cross, Jesus didn't simply die the death that I deserve; he also gave me the result of a life I never lived. Jesus die taking the punishment for my sin, he was rejected instead of me, he took upon himself the consequences of my unacceptable life.

He dieded to save me, yes! But also died to make me like him. He gave me his righteousness, his right standing before the Father, his perfect, acceceptable life, is now my life. He was rejected so that I could be accepted. To put another way, I was crushed under a debt that I could never pay on my own. Jesus didn't simply pay off my overdraft, he also made me rich.

Now I can come to the Father confident and assured and thankful that I am accepted by him in a way that I could never acheieve or secure on my own. The cross doesn't just reveal to us extent of human sin and it consequences, it is shows the wonderful, bottomless depths of God's love for us.

The hymn writer Willian Rees summed it up this way:

> "On the mount of crucifixion,
> Fountains opened deep and wide;
> Through the floodgates of God’s mercy
> Flowed a vast and gracious tide.
> Grace and love, like mighty rivers,
> Poured incessant from above,
> And heav’n’s peace and perfect justice
> Kissed a guilty world in love."

Our lives in and of themselves are unacceptable to God. But what makes Good Friday 'good' Is that Jesus was rejected so that we could be accepted.
