# 2016-06-10 Sermon - Stories Jesus Told: Part IV (Matthew 20:1-6)

## 0. Introduction (450)

>Recently I hit a parenting milestone. A rite of passage. The momeant that every parent knows is coming, but they hope, against all odds will never happen. I remember it well. It was a Thursday morning. I was making breakfast and Jonah ways at the table eating his cearel. As the smell of fresh coffee filled the kitchen, Jonah turned and asked, "Daddy?"

>"Yes, Jonah" I replied.

>"Can I have something else?"

>"Have you finished your cereal?" I inquired, knowing full well the answer to my own question.

>"No..." He sighed.

>"Well you know it works, Jonah. You you can have something else, only if you've finished what you already have." This was a well rehearsed breakfast patter that we shared most morning. We knew our lines, or so I thought.

>"But... but..." Usually, at this point, Jonah would say. "Fine..." Turn around and continue eating. Only today, something changed he said "But that's not fair!"

>And there it was. from now on whenever things looked they were not going his way, Jonah could appeal to some external standard of justice. One which would always present him as the disadvantaged victem of an oppressive dictator called 'dad'.

But in all seriousness, Jonah is a great kid and were very thankful for him. And whilst I used that story with his permission, I do it to illustrate an important observation about our lives.  

Because In many ways we never grow out of that four year old view of fairness. When someone treats in away we feel is unfair we become the victim of a cosmic injustice. When we act the same way, we are the exception to the rule.

Truth is that whether four or ninety-four *our basic undestanding of fairness is often seriously off centre*! That's true in how we relate to others, but most especially it can be true of how we relate to God. *Or maybe, how we expect God to relate to us*.

In this mornings story that Jesus told, he is going to use a tale about fair pay to flip our undestanding of fairness on its head. And as he does that we are going to see something important. 

*We're going to see that "Delighting in God's outrageous favour leads us to love our neighbour."* {Slide} {Repeat}

To help explain this parable, we are going to walk through the main events one after the other: {Slide}

1.  The Eccentric Employer (20:1-7)
2.  Checking the Paycheque (20:8-15)
3.  Who's first? (20:16)

{Repeat}

That's where we're heading this morning. keep you bible open, and let's begin.

## 1. The eccentric Employer (20:1-17) (1089)

*Firstly then, the eccentric Employer*.

Jesus begins his parable in chapter 20, verse 1 by comparing the Kingdom of Heaven to a _"landowner who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard."_ 

So Immediately, before Jesus even begins to flesh out the story. He has already given us some tools to help us unearth what this parable is trying to tell us. Here's what we know from verse 1:

*First, this parable is about the kingdom of Heaven* - which is Matthew's way of saying the Kingdom of God. It is a parable that is going to help us to understand what life is like for those who live under God's all powerful rule.

*Second, it is about what life looks like for citizen's of that kingdom*. By comparing the kingdom of God to man who hires workers for his vineyard. 

This point is particualy important because Jesus is going to introduce us to more characters as the story progresses but we can't be distracted by them. 

As Important as the other players might be The most important character is the landowner, because it is his actions that are going to illustrate to us how God acts towards his people.

Having set the scene and provided some important clues, Jesus' story begins to unfold. Heading to the marketplace the landowner finds some men who were willing to do a days works (6am-6pm) in exchange for a dinarius each. A dinarius being the going rate for a days work in the first century the men agree a head off to the vineyard. 

During Jesus day, hired workers were often take advantage of. But by agreeing the price in advance, and offering a fair wage, Jesus wants us to see that this particular landowner is both fair and honourable in the way he deals with his employees.

At the third hour (about 9am) the landowner returns to the marketplace to hire more workers for his vineyard (v3). Well that's not very surpring. Any man whose undertaken a bit of gardening knows that sometimes, it is only when you are part way through a job that you realise how much work is involved. 

And in v4, again the subject of paymeant crops up. But this time the landowner simply promises to pay them "what is right" for the work that they put in.

But what would have made the landowners actions so strange to Jesus' first hearers, and what should capture our attention too, is that the landowner goes out three more times: at midday, at 3pm, and then finally, and most bizarrely, at 5pm.

In verse 6, we're told that the landowner finds a gang of workers still waiting to be hired at the eleventh hour (about 5 o'clock in the evening). When the landowner asks them why they've been standing around all day, they reply in v7 by stating the obvious "because no one has hired us!" You don't say! 

But notice that our landowner doesn't press the issue, instead he sends them off to the vineyard with only an hour left in the working day. By not explaining why these men are out of work, Jesus leaves us to fill in the blanks - for better or worse.

And that is significant because depending on how we fill in that blank will effect how we view the landowner at this point. We might think the worst, and assume that these men hadn't been hired because they have a reputation for being lazy or dishonest. 

If so then by hiring them the landowner shows himself to be gracious. Because in giving them a job, even for an hour, he gives them what they do not deserve. An honest wage to dishonourable workers.

If we think the best, and assume that these men haven't been hired because they are unskilled, sick, or elderly. then the landowner shows himself to a compassionate man. Someone who gladly hires those at the bottom of the social ladder, men which other employers would passed over in favour of the sronger, younger, and more skilled.

Either way were are presented with a landowner whose employment practicies are unusual. Not only will he hire workers throughout the day, he'll also take those no one else wants. He'll even hire staff at 5pm when the work is almost done. 

Come 6 o'clock the workers would down tools, collect their pay and head home. So to hire men at 5pm would be crazy to Jesus' hearers, and it should seem strange to us too, eccentric even. 

After all, by the time the men walked from town to the vineyard, checked in with the foreman, been assigned a task, and gone out to work, it would be time to clock off, get paid, and head home. Clearly this is a man who is more concerned with lowering unemployment than making money. 

And yet in many ways **the landowner is picture of how God welcomes us into his kingdom**.Think about it. 

Like the landowner, **The Lord is honest and upfront with us from the start**. He tells us that entrance into his kingdom comes only through turning from sin and trusting in Jesus death and return life. 

And like the landowner *he also does what is right by us*, he doesn't tell us that our salvation is a gift today, only to make us earn it tomorrow.

Like the landowner **God is merciful too**. He is willing to overlook our reputation for sin, stubbornness, and rebellion, by giving us what we don't deserve. By giving us another shot at a renewed relationship with him, even at great cost to himseld. 

And **he is compassionate also**. It makes no matter to him whether we are old or young, healthy or ill, unskilled or a rocket scientist, home owner or gypsy traveller, British resident or illegal immigrant! God's love for us in Jesus is directed towards any and all who cross his path in repentance and faith.

It is awe inspiring. It is beautiful. And it is outrageous! 

But there is more to come. To fully understand how the landowners actions reveal what life is like in God's kingdom... we need to put down our tools, punch out, and head to the foreman's office to collect our pay. Only then will we begin to see how delighting God's outrageous favour leads us to love our neighbour.

## 2. Checking the Paycheque (20:8-15) (740)

*Second, checking the paycheque (20:8-15).* {Slide} 

The second part of Jesus' story is introduced with with another reference to the working day. For labourers in the first century, work began at Sunrise and ended at Sunset, with the expectation that they'd be paid before they were sent home that day. 

In fact, both Leviticus 19:13 and Deuteronomy 24:15 required that a hire worker was paid at the end of each day wihtout exception. And it is important to spot that this is what our landowner does too. 

Now... Notice the lengths Jesus is going to flesh out the character of this employer for us: he is honest, fair, gracious, compassionate, and now law abiding and godly too.

But watch careful, because he comes the twist. The landowner tells the foreman to give them men their pay; paying the last to 5pm workers first and the 6pm workers last.

Then in an expected twist the landowner pays all the men the same amount. Whether they've worked for twelve hours or just one, everyone receives a denarius. Everyone receives a days pay regardless of how long they've worked. That's a breathtaking display of generosity. I 

Let me ask you, does that surprise you or shock you at all? It should...

Ask yourself, what would do in that situation? How would you feel? Knowing that someone has been paid the same as you? Even though you've at it all day compared to their one hour's work? 

Would you be delighted for them? Pleased? Would you take your pay and head home with a spring in your step? In our current climate of fair pay, metoo, glass ceilings, and concrete floors. Would you be happy to be treated this way?

Or would you grumble and mutter? Band together with others who felt the same as you and confront the boss? Or Would you settle for being a keyboard worrior and dash of an angry email on the train home?

In v12, the 6am worker to take their grievance straight to the landowner:

>"These men who were hired last worked only one hour and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the work _and_ the heat of the day." 

The heart of their complaint is fairness. They feel like the landowner has committed an injustice against them by paying everyone the same. They've worked harder than everyone else, so received wisdom says, they deserve more money than everyone else.

However, the landowners final question in v13 _"Are you envious becuase I am generous?"_ is vital for understadning the parable. 

It reveals that behind the 6am workers' appeals to fairness is an attitude of bitterness and jealousy. The landowners final question, draws this out becuase his actually a trap. It is like asking someone "have you stopped robbing banks?" It asks for a yes/no answer but both answers are incriminating. 

If the workers reply "no" to the question at the end of v15 then the landowner would reply "Then why are you complaining?". If the say "yes" then they show themselves to be ungrateful and jealous - which they are. How will they answer? Now, put yourself in their sandals, how would you answer his question?

How you answer is important. becuase this not a parable about fair pay and just wages, it is a parable about The Lord God and how he destributes his grace. So if the landowner is supposed to make us think of the Lord. What does your answer reveal about your view of God's grace? 

Do you truly see it as a gift for him to give out as he sees fit? Or a wage to be earned by those who've put in the work?

Reflecting on this parable, the 6th Century theologian, warned that 

>"It is always foolish to question the goodness of God. There might have been reason for loud complaint if he did not give what he owed but not if he gives what he does not owe." 

Gregory strikes the heart of the issue. *All the while we see grace as a wage and not as a gift, we will struggle to delight in God's outrageous favour.* Instead we'll question him and struggle to love our neighbour as a result.

If we want avoid questioning God's goodness, we need to take seriously Jesus' final words in v16.

## Who's First?

*Finally then, who's first (v16).* {slide} 

Jesus words in v16 “So the last will be first, and the first will be last.” Almost seem like an afterthought. But along with verse v1 are key to helping us understand and rightly apply this parable.

You see Jesus is not giving advice on he best way to hand out the payslips. His words in v16 are not an observation about payroll, but a warning. And one to take seriously.

You see *throughout this story it is quite clear that the* honest, fair, gracious, compassionate, law abiding, godly, and generous *landowner is God.* Whilst *the landowners actions represent The Lord's dealings with people*. 

So it would be tempting, to see ourselves in the sotry as the workers who benefit from God's jaw-dropping grace and compassionate. Those who receive an eleventh hour offer when all hope seems lost. 

And on one level that might be true, especially if you are discovering the wonders and beauty of God's love for you in Christ for the very first time. But that is not where Jesus wants us to see ourselves first, not in this parable at least. 

He wants us to see ourselves in the actions and attitudes of the 6am workers - those who are grumbling and muttering of unfair treatment.

That's a hard pill to swallow, and you might react strongly at first. But consider it honestly for a moment. If we are truthful with ourselves there is always the temptation to see our relationship with God as employee employer. To slip into believing that if we do our part, God is bound to do his. 

When that happens - Health, home, family, job, income, pension, forgiveness, even salvation. All these cease to good gifts from a gracious Father and become to us like wages due for the work we've put in. 

If left unchecked this way of looking at things slowly strangles our joy and compassion for others along with it. It is recipe for discontentment and bitterness.

And *if we never tackle it we might find ourselves, like the 6am workers, told to take what is ours and go.*

Jesus words in v16, are a warning that resentment over grace given to others, a transactional view of God's love, bitterness and jealousy, coupled with a lack of compassion... 

these things may reveal that our faith is in direct straights, or was perhaps never genuine in the first place. Thinking ourselves to be first in line, we are to be last. Whilst those who we consider undeserving go into God's kingdom before us. 

*If that is the case then we need to seek the Holy Spirit and ask him to reawaken us to the beauty and wonder of what Jesus has done of us*... in dying for our sin and rising from the dead to make us right with God.

Instead we hear Jesus warning and heed it. Then *we can find both cure for our hard hearts and a surpising motivation to share our faith.* Let me show you what I mean... 

Consider again the 5pm crowd, who received a days wages for an hours work. If you were one of them, how might they be feeling on their way home? You'd be pinching yourself, unable to believe your good fortunes. No doubt you'd be celebrating with all those who'd also been on the receiving end of the landowners outrageous favour. 

Now imagine that the next day, you're explain all this to a couple of friends in the marketplace when the landowner arrives, looking for workers for the day. What now? 

Would you grumble and point? Call his unfair employer and cheapskate? Would you take his generosity for granted? telling your friends to wait until 5pm on the off chance that the he might come back and still pay you for a days work? 

Would you say "There he is. Come on let's go see him. I've never worked for anyone like him before! I'm sure he'd find work of us all and pay us what is right and fair."

*Having already been delighted bythe landowners outrageous favour before, you'd long for other people to experience it too.* His grace toward us, would motivate us to love others enough to invite them to meet him too. 

And in many ways that is a wonderful picture of the best possible motivation for evangelism. A motivation that says "I want them to know", not simply "I'll say something if they ask me".

>It many surpise you to know that I find evangelism very difficult. I am naturally an introvert, I find meeting new people draining and stressful. And if I'm honest, most days I'd rather read a book by dead person than talk to a living one. 

>Yet I find my evangelism is not its most natural and effective when I'm most sure of my bible knowledge. nor when I feel like have all answers; or when I'm most confident in my technique.

>No sharing my faith comes most naturally to me when I am most aware of God's outrageous love for me in Christ my saviour. When I am most conscious of my sin, and most thankful his grace - that is when I am most effective at sharing my faith. 

The reason is simple. That's when I want others to know and expirence what _I've_ come to know and experience. God's love for me causes me to love others enough to open my mouth and speak about my saviour. You see, When we don't treasure God's grace, we are more likely to question his goodness and grumble about others. But when we delight in God's outrageous favour, it leads us to love to neighbour by talking to them about Christ.

## Love thy Neighbour; Tell of God's Favour

Jesus parable in Matthew 20 captures our attention with a tale of an eccentric employer. It draws us it by challenging our understanding fairness as we see everyone receive the same pay regardless of how long they've worked. 

Then finally, like a stealth bomber it slips through our defences and lays before us what we truly think and feel about God's free grace to undeserving sinners.

Then Jesus finishes with a stark warning about the reversal of fortunes for those who see themselves as first and others last. It is a warning that shocks us into honest evaulation of our own attitudes. And may even call for us to seek radical intervention from the holy spirit.

As African write Joe Apolyo points out that God's outrageous "Generosity should be the cause of rejoicing not resentment. This lesson is very important for those who have been Christians for a long time, and who begin to see much younger men and women being richly blessed by God materially, spiritually or in successful ministry."

Because when we rejoice in God's kindness for us in Christ we want others to know first hand what we ourselves have expirenced.

So wherever you are today, whatever you are going through, can I encourage you...

-   Delight in God's outrageous favour
-   Love your neighbour by
-   Sharing your Saviour.

Let's pray.
