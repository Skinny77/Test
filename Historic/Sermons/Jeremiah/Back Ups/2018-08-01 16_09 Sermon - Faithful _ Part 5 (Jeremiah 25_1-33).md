# Sermon: Faithful - Part 5: A Taste of Things to Come - Part 1 (Jeremiah 25:1-33)

## Introduction (431)

If there is one thing that we all learn fairly quickly it is this: actions have consequences. Think about it, it is obvious isn't it! Actions have consequences.

Some actions have postive consequences. For example, if you make on the payments on a hire purchase at the end of the plan you own the car. As a general rule those who work hard in education do better in life.

Some consequences are neutral - neither positive or negative. If I throw something in the air like this, gravity will eventually bring it back down. That's neither good nor bad, it's just something that happens.

Other actions have negative, even disastrous consequences. If you kill someone, you go to prision - despite what the Daily Mail might say. If you don't pay you mortgage, your house will be repossed.

Actions have consequences. We all know it is true. And what is true for our actions in the world around us is true for actions towards God. Something which Jeremiah is going to press home today, in chapter 25:1-33.

The road map for our time together this morning looks like this:

1.  Consequences for God's People (Jeremiah 25:1-14)
2.  Consequences for the Nations (Jeremiah 25:15-33)
3.  Consequences for God's Son (Romans 5:6-11)

Now I know what your thinking... I know happy sermon on a happy chapter of Jeremiah! I'm not going to pretend that Jeremiah is an easy book, it isn't. But it is as much God's word as John 3:16 or Psalm 23, which means it has a lot to teach us if we're willing to listen. So let's get stuck in and see what Jeremiah has for us today.

## 1. Consequences for God's People (25:1-14) (1106)

Firstly, then, Consequences for God's People. Jeremiah 25:1-14.

I wonder what comes to mind when you think of the discipline you experienced growing up? Would you say your parents were fair? Did the epunishment always fit the crime or did you ever feel lie they were over reacting? Did they have a favourite or did they treat you all fairly?

My parents did the best job with the hand they were dealt - they weren't perfect, but then, what parent is? But I'll always remember how when my Dad started counting you did not want him to get past three!

There were times when I really wanted to call his bluff, but I never had the bottle to get much past two. My eldest sister though... I can remember several times when she'd call him out. He'd start counting and she'd just stare him down. As far as I can remember, every time she was reminded that that he was not bluffing.

Jeremiah 25:1-2 begin by setting the scene. We're about halfway through Jeremiah's ministry now and everything is about to change for God's people. It is the point when everything changes for the Book of Jeremiah too, from here on out Jeremiah's message goes from "this is what will happen if you don't return to God" to "this is what _has_ happened because you would not return to God." The Lord's finished counting to three, but his people have decided to call him out.

Now they're about to find the hard way that he was not bluff. It's 605BC and by the time year is out, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon will have completed the first of four invasions which will see more and more of God's people carried off into exile. And ultimately, come to a climax in the sacking of Jerusalem and the destruction of the temple in 587BC.

Jeremiah's God given warnings are about to come true. Countless thouands will be displaced, countless more will die. And in the end they will know, that God was not bluffing. Their sinful actons have serious consequences.

At this point, we need to hit the pause button. For many of us we are so used to hearing about God's love, grace, mercy, and forgiveness, when we come face-to-face with God's anger and wrath in passages like this, it can be a hard pill to swallow.

But I think part of the battle in understanding it is nowing the right questions to ask. When hearing about God's jdugement, we can be tempted to ask "Is God really like that?"

But if God really is all those things - loving, gracious, merciful, forgiving, then a better question to ask is, "What would make God do this to his own people?"

Jeremiah 25:3-7 help us answer that questions.

What might surprise you is that first thing we learn about the reason behind God's judgement is that the people have tested his paitence one too many times. And he has been incredibly paitent.

Look at v3, Jeremiah tells that for twenty-three years he has faithful spoken the warnings that God has given them. And he says "but you have not listened." Twenty-three years! Can you imagine what it must have been like for Jeremiah? God giving him the same message day in day out, and yet getting the same response from the people day-in-day out!

But Jeremiah's ministry is just a drop in the ocean compared to God's long suffering paitence with his people. Becuase it is not just jeremiah they have ignored, it is all the prophets who've gone before him too. Propehts like

-   Jonah
-   Amos
-   Hosea
-   Isaiah
-   Micah
-   Nahum
-   Joel
-   Zephaniah
-   and Habakkuk

Nine prophets spanning over 170 years all warning God's people "This is what will happen if you continue to follow the false God's of the nations and reject the Lord, the one true God." Even when the Assyrian's destroyed the Northern Kingdom of Israel in 722BC. God's people in the south still didn't get the message. Their rules flip-flopped in their political relationships, as th ehearts of the people flip-flopped between the Lord and forgien idols. Yet the whole time God's prophets faithful warned God's people. Both the carrot and the stick of their Holy Spirit inspired messages are summarised for us in v5-6.

First the carrot, the positive encouragement in v5: "Turn now, each of you, from your evil ways and your evil practices, and you can stay in the land the LORD gave to you and your fathers for ever and ever."

And then the stick, the negative warning in v6: "Do not follow other gods to serve and worship them; do not provoke me to anger with what your hands have made. Then I will not harm you."

But as verse 7 reminds us, they did not listen those who came before any more than they listen to Jeremiah. For a 170 years God patiently warned and encouraged his people through the prophets he sent them. 170 years! I don't know about you, but when my kids are playing sometimes I struggle to keep my paitence for 170 seconds!

Suddenly God's actions are put in a whole new light. For three generations his anger has been slowly building as his patient waited for his wayward people to return to him. But now God's done counting to three, and it's time for his people to learn that his actions have consequences.

There's both an irony and a fittedness to God's punishment. Since they were so keen to serve a forgein king rather than be ruled by the Lord, and since they were so keen to follow forgien God's rather than worship the God of Israel. The Lord Gives them what they want! Those who don't die in Nebuchadnezzar's invasions are carried off to live in the Babylonian empire, the home of the Babylonian kings and religion for severnty years.

The actions have had dire consequences and God's slow building anger and incredible patiences has insured that the punishment judtily fits the crime. But as verses 12-14 hint, Babylon's actions will have consequences too. Just like ripples on a pond spread out from the point where the stone breaks the surface, God's justice is going to ripple out to Bablyion and even to the ends of the earth.

## 2. Consequences for the Nations (25:15-33)

Secondly, Consequences for the Nations. Jeremiah 25:15-33.

IN his infamous book the _The God Delusion_, biologist Richard Dawkins, says that

> "The God of the Old Testament is arguably the most unpleasant character in all fiction: jealous and proud of it; a petty, unjust, unforgiving control-freak; a vindictive, bloodthirsty ethnic cleanser; a misogynistic, homophobic, racist, infanticidal, genocidal, filicidal, pestilential, megalomaniacal, sadomasochistic, capriciously malevolent bully.‚Äù

Now it won't surprise you that I think Dawkins' is wide of the mark in his description of God revealed in the Old Testament. But let's no grab our troches and pitchforks, just yet.

Remember, we have just read a passage from the Old Testament about God's judgement coming down on not just his own people, but the nations surrounded them, and indeed the world.

<!-- Illustration: Some actions have punitive consequences, the purpoise is not to restore but to punish (loosing your job for failing to turn up) -->

## 3. Consequences for God's Son (Romans 5:6-11)

## Conclusion

<!-- There are a host of reasons why we might think that our actions are of no consequences to God. Some of the fault probably lies with church leaders. many churches both publicly and in the their teaching ministry would rather focus on God's love than God's justice. Understandably, some might say 'well, God is love, isn't it his job to forgive me?'.

Others of us I suspect, struggle with God's justice because deep down we don't think we are actually that bad. Not compared to everyone else at least. 'Surely God would be more concerned with mass murders, paedophiles, and terrorists, wouldn't he?'

Some of us though are very aware that we don't feel good enough, like we've fallen short of God's standard. But we still don't see God's justice rightly. We think that if we try hard enough to do better, or even just feel really awful about ourselves. God might overlook our actions, like judge giving a lesser sentence to criminal who shows remorse.

But today's passage is going to confront us with some comfortable truths. God is as just as he is loving and so must always punish sin. We are much worse than we think we are. And no amount of trying harder or feeling awful can make the consequences go away... -->
