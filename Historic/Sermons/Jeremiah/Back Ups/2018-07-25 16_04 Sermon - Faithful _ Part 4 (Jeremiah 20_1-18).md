## Introduction

Let's be clear on something from the start. If you live long enough you will experience suffering. And suffering is not a gentleman. It does not call ahead or give fair warning, it does not does ask for a convenient time and place, and, most of all, it does not ask permission. It invades our lives without our consent and then, like an awkward guest, refuses to leave.

This was certainly the experience of Christian author C.S. Lewis, writer of the Children's classic the Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. In his last book "A Grief Observed", he records his journey to come terms with the death of his wife. A loss which he describes as being like an 'amputation' and as all encompassing as the sky above him. His experiences are an important reminder than that we need to have a working and biblical view of suffering, before we experience it. Because we will have no time to do so, nor will we want to, when suffering is busy turning our well ordered lives upside down.

Certainly, at times suffering can cause us to mature and grow as we see a loving God mysteriously at work behind what feels like the iron fist. Other times it can rock the very fabric of our lives, causing us to despair at our circumstances and doubt God's character. C.S. Lewis experienced both of these extremes as he traveled the wellworn road of suffering and so did the prophet Jeremiah.

Mocked by the people he came to warn, put in stocks, left to die at the bottom of an empty well, put in prision, acacused of being a liar, a traitor, and fraud. Even the people of his hometown of Anathoth conspired to have him killed. His life was one of pain and suffering, a peppered throughout hte book of Jeremiah are five heartfelt cries or complaints where Jeremiah cries out to God with a uniquely human response to suffering "why?".

Today will look at Jeremiah's final and most honest complaint in Jeremiah 20:7-18. In chapter 19:14-20:6 Jeremiah is beaten and put in public stocks for declaring God's judgeemnt on Judah for their rebellion against him. It is here, beaten, imprisioned, and publicly humiliated that he begins to reflect on that has happed to him. And as he does he is moved to cry out to God is the midst of his pain and suffering. Jeremiah's raw and heartfelt pray will not help us to form a biblical view of suffering before we experience it, it is also going to help us understand how to respond to God in the midst of our suffering. But most of all it is going to shows us something deceptively simple: Faithfully following Jesus is hard. {repeat}

We going to explore this passage and this truth under three simple headings:

1.  Down in the valley (20:7-10)
2.  Up on the Mountain (20:11-13)
3.  Down the other side (20:14-18)

# Down in the valley (20:7-10)

Firstly, let's joing Jeremiah down in the valley...

If there is one thing that I cannot stand it is scammers. We don't have a landline, our mobile numbers are x-directory, and my email spam filter is turned up to 11 and yet there is still no escaping them.

I bet you know the ones I mean...

The phone rings, "hello?"

"Hello sir, we've been informed that you are due a refund on your PPI." Hang up...

"You're out on walk and your phone buzzes in your pocket. It's a text "Good afternoon, our records indicate that you've recently been involved in a car accident that wasn't your fault. If you'd like to be texted constantly for three weeks, then reply with 'STOP' at any time."

Or you open your inbox and there's an email from YourBank@instascam.com trying to convince you that there has been fraudulent activity on your account and then need to you email them, immediately, with you bank account number, sort code, and inside leg measurement.

One level I can't help but think, who actually falls for this stuff, and then I realise, surely someone must because they keep sedning them.

Jeremiah's prayer begins in with a shocking confession from the prophet, he believes that God has deceived him when he called him to become a prophet. Jeremiah essentially likens the Lord to a PPI cold caller or email scmamer. He might have appeared to be the real deal, but Jeremiah seems to think that God is, in fact, actually only out for himself. Now that Jeremiah is on the hook, the Lord has reeled him in and there is no esacpe. It is a pretty shocking, almost blamsphemous accusation for Jeremiah to make. But before we pull away in horror, or try to make embarrassed excuses for Jeremiah, let's try to understand what it is that might make him feel this way. And then ask ourselves the question, is there any truth in is accusation?

The 'why' of Jeremiah's accusation is spelled out in the next three and half verses.
