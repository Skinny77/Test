# Sermon - Faithful - Part 1 (Jeremiah 1_1-19)

## 0. Introduction: Why Bother with Jeremiah?

<!-- 457/450 Words -->

In 1985, The New York Times ran an article about a new form of technology that tech companies were convinced would change the world forever. The journalist who wrote the article was not so sure. Convinced it was a passing craze they wrote:

> On the whole, people don't want to lug a ... with them to the beach or on a train to while away hours they would rather spend reading the sports or business section of the newspaper. Somehow, the {Industry} has assumed that everyone would love to have a keyboard grafted on as an extension of their fingers. It just is not so.

What is the journalist describing?

Answer: The Laptop Computer.

Desktop computers at home and in the workplace had experienced a measure of a success, but a portable computer? Don't be absurd! This particular journalist _convinced_ beyound doubt a portable computer was destined for failure. It was a fad, a flash in the pan! At best any previous success was only an indicator that its best years were already behind it. No, no, it was best to move on now than to try an deny the inevitable. To suggest otherwise was utter foolishness.

Truth is many, inside and outside the church might say the same Christianity in our day. Churches closing, congregations shrinking, whole generations missing. Sure Christianity had a good run, but past success is simply an indicator that we've had our day. To suggeest otherwise is utter foolishness.

Sitting here this morning you might be forgive for thinking "Why bother with the book of Jeremiah?" A 400 year old collection of 'predictions' about some ancient part of the world, and some ancient people who are nothing like me. What does Jeremiah know about my struggles? About family breakdown, emotional heartache, and poor mental health? What does he know about church decline, spiritual doubts, and the pressures of being a faithful follower of Christ in 2018?

If that's what you're thinking you are infor a surrise. Because Jeremiah is a book whose central characters are a God whose heart breaks for the sin of his people even as his unimaginably slow building angry reaches boiling point. And his prophet, Jeremiah, who struggles with personal doubt, unimaginable suffering, and emotional pain as his seeks to be a faithful a voice among a people who his message of repetence and judgement from God sounded like utter foolishness.

And yet over the next ten weeks, and today particularly, we are going see to that **If we want to be faithful to Christ, we are going to look foolish to the world** {Repeat}

In our passage today that foolishness plays itself out in three way:

1.  A Messenger who feels foolish (v1-9)
2.  A Message that sounds foolish (v11-16)
3.  A Mission that looks foolish (v10, 17-19)

{Repeat}

## 1.  A Messenger who feels foolish (v1-9)

<!-- 1050/1000 words -->

Before I started watching boxsets with Abi, I often used to skip epidodes that I suspected were filler. You know, episodes that spent forty minutes explaining something that could be done in three minutes of good dialogue. Most of the time this wasn't a problem, but occasionally I miss a vital piece of information which meant that when a character was introduced three or four episodes later I had no idea who they were or why they were such a big deal. Often this meant going back to find which episode contained the vital information I had passed over.

Like many prophetic books in the Old Testament Jeremiah opens with a little historical summery. At first glance it can read like filler 'Jeremiah son of some bloke, from some town, in some place, who lived during the reign of some kings.' SKIP!!! Move on to v4 where the plot seems to get going a bit. But if we do that we are going miss some information that's vital for understanding this book and this chapter.

You see the Holy Spirit includes these details at the beginning of this book to remind us that we are deailing wih historal person. So when we look at v4-9, v1-3 remind us that Jeremiah's encounter with the LORD isn't simply a spiritual event, but also historical event. Something that actually happened. So when Jeremiah says in v4 "the word of the Lord came to me" he is giving us a window into a personal encounter he had with the Living God.

And when we look at v4-9 we notice two things. Firstly, this is a dialogue. The Lord speaks v5, Jeremiah replies v6, the Lord answers v7-9. The other thing we notice is that it is the Lrod who take the initiative with Jeremiah. It doesn't say in v4 that Jeremiah sought out the word of the Lord, but instead that the Word of sought out Jeremiah. This encounter might have teken Jeremiah by surprise but not the Lord, he'd been preparing the prophet for this moment he was born. The Lord had planned it all long before Jeremiah even was born.

Don't believe me? Take a look at those  four actions words in verse 5. Look at the way they build off each other and develop: I formed you, I knew you, I set up you, I appointed you. It's as if the Lord says to Jeremiah, "Son, I had my eye on you since before you were a twinkle in your daddy's eye. I've made you like one of those objects in the temple that can only be used in service of me. Your my megaphone, Jeremiah, my messenger to Jerusalem, Judah, Samaria, and the ends of the earth." Its incredible language.

Jeremiah's reply is not surprising. Far from saying "when do we get sorted Lord?" in v6 he tells the all knowing cretor of the univserse that he has made a mistake. His objection  falls into two broad categories: he's the wrong age and he lacks experience. In defence of Jeremiah, at least he's objections were genuine. When he says that he is child, he uses a Hebrew word that is most often used to describe a boy bwteen the ages of 7 and 14. Jeremiah really is just a kid, and no doubt to a young boy living a back water Anathoth, the thought of being God's messenger boy to the nations likely terried the pants off him. So when Jeremiah says "I can't speak", he's saying "I don't know hw to speak like a prophet. What if I make a fool of myself?"

Face with the enormous task Jeremiah feels foolishly inadequate for the task God has set before him. He cannot see in himself, what the Lord sees, surely he has made a mistake. But the LORD doesn't make mistakes, as he gently and gracious reminds the young boy in v7-9 that Jeremiah's God is far bigger and stronger than Jeremiah's doubts. Reminding reminds us and him, that there are no volunteers in God's Kingdom, only conscripts. As the final proof that Jeremiah's age and experience are irrelevant in this matter, the Lord promises that his presence, the Holy Spirit, will be with Jeremiah every step of the way. As a proof, he gives him a sign, he touches the boy's mouth - from know on he will give Jeremiah the words say. It is a beautiful picture, the God of universe stoops to calm the fears of a small boy.

But Jeremiah's fears are so often our own aren't they? We might not complain that we are too young, but we might complain that now is not the right to time to obey the Lord in hi call - when I finish school lord, when the kids have left home, when I've retired, when I've enjoyed my retirement a bit, then, then I'll be ready to obey your call.

In the same way we often appeal to our own lack of expxirence. I could never share my faith, I don't know how. What if I make a mistake? What if I look foolish? Into this mix comes the lies of the enemy, "you probably would, better not to say anything. Besides your only one person - its foolish to think you can make a difference?"

But we forget that the Lord Jesus was only one man, born in a backwater village near Jerusalem. A man who lived to serve the Lord, despite opposition, misunderstanding and mockery. One man who died a fools death on a roman cross. A death in our place, for our sins. Yet rose from the dead victorious and changed the world forever. Like Jeremiah, we are his megaphone through which he calls the world to repentance and faith. Just as the Lord promised Jeremiah that his word and his presence would always be with him, so we too carry his Word in our hands and the Holy Spirit in our hearts. Knowing with full aussrence that were the Word of the Lord is heard, there the Holy Spirit as work.

Using a child to change a nation; using us, his people, to change world. It sounds like utter foolishness. But **If we want to be faithful to Christ, we are going to look foolish to the world** Because it is through what the world views as foolish, that God's power is revealed.

## 2. The Message Sounds Foolish

Secondly, the message sounds foolish.

The name Harold Camping doesn't mean much now. But back in early 2011 was all over thew news as the California bible teacher who famously predicted the end of the world... three times. The secret to Camping's predictions, was that he claimed to  have discovered secret mathematical codes hidden in bible. So if one could find th eclues and crunch the numbers, tthey could predict the day of Jesus' return. Having previously predicted that Jesus would return on 6th September 1994, Camping supposedly returned to the bible, reassed the prophecies and came up with a new date. 21st May 2011. When Jesus failed to make an appearance, once agian Camping said it was merely a miscalculated again, and promised that the bible was clear. The end of the world would be 21st October 2011. This time, when the world woke up on 2nd October no one cared.

Now Harold Camping was an extreme example. But he raises an important question about Old Tesmanet prophecy. Many of Jeremiah's message from the Lord, include the one in the chapter, contain predictions about the future. So how are we supposed to work out what future events they are talking about? Do we need to crunch the numbers like Harold Camping or should we be watching the headlines for clues? How can we be sure that the distater from the North in v14 is Nicola Sturgeon and SNP who'll act as the LORd's instrument of judgemen on Westminster for take the UK out of the EU?

Harold Camping was correct in that bible does contain clues for how to understand its prophecies, the problem was he was looking for the wrong kind of clues. They not secret number codes that we need to crunch, but scraps of information that Jeremiah's first readers would have recognised. Once we have those clues and can answer the question "What did this prophecy mean for them?" WE are in a much better position to answer the question "What does it mean for us?" So let's take a look at Jeremiah's message in v11-16 and see if we can follow the clues together.

Veres 11-16 continue the dialogue between the Lord and Jeremiah continues. The Lord has already told Jeremiah that he will tell him what to say, and his reassured him of this with a physical sign. Now the Lord outlines what that message is with to visual illustrations. A almond branch and a boiling pot.

At first glance the Almond branch vision seems bizarre. What on earth does a old stick have to do with God's word? If you have a red bible in front of you you'll see a footnote on v12 that tells us that the Hebrew word for 'Almond' sounds like the Hebrew word for 'watch'. Through this visual word play the Lord is once again reassuring Jeremiah. The vision's purpose is to give Jeremiah confidence during his long ministry that the Lord will bring his purposes to pass, and what his prophet speaks will happen. IN fact Jeremiah's home town of Anathoth was and still is famous for its Almond groves. So as Jeremiah drew up and whenever he returned home as saw those almond trees he would be reminded of God's promise to him. Again is a picture of God's wonderful gentleness with this young prophet.

And I don't know about you. But I want to imitate the Lord's example with my own children and God willing my grandchildren too. Sure the Lord is firm with Jeremiah, but he is also fair, gentle, gracious, he is kind, and slow to anger. He doesn't excuse Jeremiah's fears or weaknesses, but he doesn't dismiss them or ignore them either. Instead he is patient and compassaionate. So often that is not a picture of my parenting, and I am thankful that Jesus death atones for those mistakes. But daily I seek God's grace, because by the PSirit's help, that's the parent I want to be. And as Family Pioneer, that's the kind of parenting I want our church to promote... parenting that is modelled on God's own heart.

After the almond tree vision, we told in v13, that again the word of the Lord came to him. And again the Lord ask him what he sees. A boiling pot that is learning to the north. This time the vision is a picture of what will become the central thread of Jeremiah's ministry. In the same way that a pot left on the heat and ignore boils over. So the Lord's anger against the Kingdom of Judah has been slowly building generations and is now about to boil over in fierce judgement. That judgement will take the form of invasion from the North. An army will come and set up thrones in capital, Jerusalem, as a sign of victory and conquest. They'll demolish her walls and invade her towns. This is what Jeremiah will proclaim to the people and this is what will be sign of that the Lord judgement has come.

For almost half the book the idnity of this nation is a mystery, but we are given a big clue in chapter 1:3 with a reference to the exile. In 605 BC Nebuchadnezzar, King of Babylon, a genuine historical figure, lead four invasions of Judah resulting the the captured people being deported to Babylon. But Nebuchadnezzar's compaign would reach its peak 18 years later in 587 BC, when when he came and destroyed Jerusalem, burned the temple to thr ground, and took all but weakest and poorest people into exile in Babylon.

The identity of the northern invaders might be a secret in v14-15, but the reason that the Lord will send them is not. He spells it out loud and clear for Jeremiah in v16. There the Lord God tells his prophet that this judgement will come upon his chosen people because they have consistently and deliberately turned their back on him. instead they've run off after other God's and worshipped and served created things, rather than the creator God. Throughout this book we are going to hear Jeremiah call God's people to account for the wickedness, their oppression of the poor, their neglect of the duties to those around them, for murder, adultery, lying, political and regilous corruption. But all those things Jeremiah say are simply symptoms of a deeper issue. At the heart of the Lord's comaplint agiainst his people is not social practices and moral beliefs, but regilous practives and theological beliefs.

If you are new to Christianity or you've never thought very deeply about these things before here that the Lord sends invaders against his people because of their religious beliefs probably sounds quite shocking. But I would ask you to hang in there. Next week and over the coming weeks, we going to see how in the end the judgement the Lord promised for Judah was inevitable and unavoid. But especially next week, we'll begin to get a flavour for the seriousness of idolatry and its consequences for us and the world we live in.

For now, I simply want you to see how foolish this message sounds. Imagine you were one of Jeremiah's first listeners. "SOrry Jeremiah, you're saying that God is going to punish our entire nation because lit a joss stick and put by a staue on my mantlepeice? It's not very inclusive is it? Or attractive? Your a prophet on the national religion, your not supposed be talking about forgien invades. Your supposed to tell us that things are going great, and if we make a few lifestyle changes, they'll be even better! That's what the people what to hear, Jeremiah, why can't you say that?"

But when you think about it. Is Jeremiah's message any less foolish sounding than ours? As Christian we are convinced that the human race is headed for a universe day of judgement when all people will stand before the throne of God and give an account for the things they have done. And since we believe that everyone everwhere has fallen short of God's standard, every human being who ever lived is destined to spend eternity experiencing nothing but the holy and just wrath of God direct towards them and their sin. And we believe that humanities only hope a Galilean rabbi born to virgin, teenage mum 2000 years ago in southern Israel.

A we bleive to be God himself. A who raised the dead, walked on water, died on a cross, and rose again from the dead before ascending bodily into heaven. We believe that he died to take the punishment for our sins, and that if we turn from our current way of living, and trust him forgiveness not only will we expirnece forgiveness now, but will spend an eternity with him and others like us in a new, restored, universe.

Jeremiah's message sounds foolish precisely because it is an Old Testament example of an New Testament principle. Paul puts it this way 1 Corinthians 1:18, "For the message of the Cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God." Like Jeremiah our message sounds foolishness to a world that has turned its back on God, and yet that is the message that God calls us to faithfully share with those around us. Some will, by God's grace, will see our message for what it is as be saved, but many will ignore it, misunderstand it, even mock it. But he as not called us to worry about the result but rather to be faithful messagengers. Knowing full well, that like Jeremiah, and the Lord Jesus before us, being faithful to God, will mean looking foolish to the world.

## A Mission that Looks Foolish

So picture the scene with me your in the car heading home. You've just picked up your ten year old son from school. "how was your day?" you ask.

"Fine" They reply.

"Anything insteresting happen?"

"Ummm.. I found an almond branch in the playground and then pot boiled over in the school cateen."

"Oh really..."

"Yep, and now I need you to take me to the BBC newsroom."

"Um why? because I have a message from God. If the nation doesn't turn back to God then the Russians are going to invade and burn down the houses of parliment!"

Shocked pause. "uh and did God say when this invasion was going to take place?"

"In about 2058 - so we've got to hurry!"

If you'd finish that conversation feeling concerned for the mental health of your child, think how Jeremiah's parents must of felt. But as we've seen already that this is what Jeremiah was called to and this was message he was to share with the nation.

In v10, the Lord begins to flesh out for Jeremiah what that will mean for him. He tells him that his message will be one of judgement. That through his preaching Jeremiah see God uproot entire people, tear down fortresses, destroy nations, and overthrow kings both in Judah and in the nations that surrounded her. But it wouldn't be all doom and gloom for Jeremiah, his messages of judgement would be tempered with hope. Even through judgement God would still build up and replant his people, even if most of that building and planting wouldn't happen until the people were already in Babylon.

Its a hard meesage that Jeremiah would have to speak and it was a hard mission that the Lord had called him to. Day in day out Jeremiah faithfully warned the people off their current course and called them back to the Lord. Although only three kings are mentioned in the historical summery in v1-3, Jeremiah would see five kings of Judah's kings fall from power in his forty year ministry. It wasn't until the those forty years were almost up that Jermeiah's prophecies began to come true.

For most of that time he was a accused of being a liar, a false prophet, a traitor, a deserter, and conspiring with forgiein powers. Yet even when Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon began his conquest of Judah in 605 BC still the people and their rulers would not listen. At times Jeremiah was imprisioned, put in public stocks, and even thrown down a empty well. His mission was opposed by the people, the priests, flase prophets, and kings. Even the people of his home town of Anathoth tried to murder him. DUring that time jeremiah would doubt his own calling and even God's character. Untop of the burden of his mission he was often burdened by his own inadequacies and sins, as well as his own mental health. Ultimately, Jeremiah would die alone and opposed in Egypt, the last place he wanted to be.

Given all that Jeremiah would face as he group up into his calling, it is fitting that his encounter with God would end in v17-19 with both a charge and a promise. Jermiah's charge in v 17 has three parts. Firstly, Jeremiah is to prepare himself for what lies ahead like a soilder prepares for war. Secondly, he is to only speak what the Lord tells him to speak. And finally, to fear offending his God more than he fears offending his people.

Paul Williams in his book "Interntial: Evangelism that takes people to Jesus" says that The Bible's answer to fear in evangelism is not complicated. It is to fear God more than people... It is Christ who is the all-powerful Lord of the universe. Our future is ultimately in his hands, not in the hands of those who oppose us." Many of us, myself included no this truth in theory, it much harder to believe it in practice. At times Jeremiah seemed to know implicitly what Paul Williams calls the "Secret to fear in Evangelism" other times he would have to learn it the hard way.

The Lord knows that the road ahead will be hard for his young prophet and so in his grace and goodness follows up his charge with a promise. In v18-19, God promises to keep Jeremiah as secure as fortified city, as strong as an iron pillar and immovable as bronze wall. But notitce that this is not a promise of an easy life, God makes no guarantee like that to any of us. They will fight against him - he'll suffer and be opposed - but never overcome - Through Jeremiah, God will always have the last word.

Many of us would consider it utterly foolish to put such huge expectations on a chidl so young. Surely the wait of this task will crush them, they'll bound to give up. And on occasion Jeremiah almost did. He is God's prophet, his words are God's words, and were God's word is there the Holy Spirit is too. God's presence would go with God's prophet and that to to save.

When we consider at all that Jeremiah will endure throughout his life it is hard not to think of Jesus. misunderstood by rulers, opposed by religious establishement, and rejected by his own people. Along with all the might of Satan himself, the fought aginast him and for a time it look like the succeeded. They hung him on a cross, left him to die, and then sealed his body in a tomb. But Jesus was adament from the beginning that as foolish as this sounds this was his mission from the start. His death for pay for sin and bring live and hope to his people. As foolish as the cross looked, it wasn't the end, he rose again in victory three days later, break the curse of death asn security eternity for all who trust in him.

And in Matthew 28:16-20 Jesus gives us his people a misison, to go and tell everyone everywhere just what he has acheived and what he offers those who come to him. Promising that as we he will be with us through the good times and the bad, even to the very end of the age. Like Jeremiah's mmission, to many ours will sound like a fools errand too. But if we want to be faithful to God, we going to look foolish in the eyes of the world.

## Playing the fool?

From get go God's call on Jeremiah's life made him feel foolish in light of his own inadequacies and inexperience. To many Jeremiah's message and mission sounded equally as foolish. Yet the would be with him ensuring that Jermeiah remain a messagener faithful to his mission and his message through the highs and lows of his forty year ministry.

Many years later the Lord Jesus would do the same despite what people thought of him, his message and his mission. And through His faithfulness even to the point of death Jesu shas changed both our lives and our world forever.

Fast forwarding to our own day. Many of us strggule with our own sense of inadequency and inexperience for the task God as laid before us. We fear that our message sound foolish or that we ourselves might look foolish as we try to stay faithful to God's mission. But we are reminded that like Jeremiah, the Holy Spirit goes before us, beside us, and behind us. People may think we are on a fools errand, they may even fight against us, but they will not overcome us because the Lord is with us and has promised to keep us safe - not from the trails of life - but through them. Faithfulness to go, requires us to look foolish to the world. But that's ok too, because when God's people look foolish, God's power is most clearly seen.

Let's pray.
