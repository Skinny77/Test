# Sermon: Faithful - Part 4: The Burden of Faithfulness (Jeremiah 20:1-18)

## Introduction (510 words)

> Let's be clear on something from the start. If you live long enough you will experience suffering. And suffering is not a gentleman. It does not call ahead or give fair warning.
>
> it does not ask for a convenient time and place, and, most of all, it does not ask permission. It invades our lives and then, like an awkward guest, refuses to leave.
>
> This was certainly the experience of Christian author C.S. Lewis, writer of the Children's classic The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.
>
> In his last book "A Grief Observed", he records his journey to come terms with the death of his wife. A loss which he describes as being like an 'amputation' and covering everything like the sky above him.
>
> Certainly, at times suffering can cause us to mature and grow as we see a loving God mysteriously at work behind our experiences. Other times it can rock the very fabric of our lives, causing us to despair at our circumstances and doubt God's character.
>
> C.S. Lewis experienced both of these extremes as he travelled the well-worn road of suffering and so did Jeremiah.

Jeremiah's life was one of pain and suffering. And peppered his early ministry are five heartfelt cries or complaints where he cries to God with a uniquely human response to suffering... "why?".

Today we will look at Jeremiah's final and most honest complaint in chapter 20:7-18. In the verses leading up to it, Jeremiah is beaten and put in public stocks for declaring God's judgement on Judah for their rebellion against him. 

It is here, bruised, imprisoned, and publicly humiliated that he begins to reflect on all that has happen to him. And as he does he is moved to cry out to God in the midst of his pain and suffering.

Jeremiah's raw and heartfelt prayer will not only help us to form a biblical view of suffering before we experience it, it is also going to help us understand how to respond to God in the midst of our suffering.

But most of all it is going to remind us of something very simple: **Faithfully following Jesus is hard and the burden of faithfulness is heavy.** {Repeat}

We'll be thinking about that as we explore Jeremiah's prayer under three headings:

1.  Down in the valley (20:7-10)
2.  Upon the Mountain Top (20:11-13)
3.  Over the edge (20:14-18)

## Down in the valley (20:7-10) (939 Words)

Firstly, let's join Jeremiah down in the valley...

> If there is one thing that I cannot stand it is scammers. We don't have a landline, our mobile numbers are x-directory, and my email spam filter is turned up to 11 ... but there is still no escaping them.
>
> I bet you know the ones I mean...
>
> The phone rings, "hello?"
>
> "Hello sir, we've been informed that you are due a refund on your PPI." Hang up...
>
> You're out on a walk and your phone buzzes in your pocket. It's a text "Good afternoon, our records indicate that you've recently been involved in a car accident that wasn't your fault. If you'd like to be texted constantly for three weeks, then reply with 'STOP' at any time."
>
> Or you open your inbox and there's an email from **YourBank@instascam.com** trying to convince you that you need to reply, immediately, with your bank account number, sort code.
>
> on One level I can't help but think, who actually falls for this stuff, and then I realise, surely someone must because they keep doing it.
>
> Jeremiah's prayer begins in with a shocking confession, where he likens God to a PPI cold caller or email scammer. Jeremiah believes that God has deceived him when he called him to become a prophet. Wow, what on earth would make Jeremiah say such a thing? The rest of v7-10 spell out Jeremiah's reasons.

Jeremiah says that he is mocked and laughed at because his message is only every about judgement. A judgement that seems so distant that the people doubt it will even come true. Worse yet, Jeremiah feels like he doesn't have a choice in the matter.

Even when he resolves not to speak in the God's name, the prophecies burst out of him. As a result, the people hate him and even his friends conspire against him.

At the heart of Jeremiah's complaint in the opening verses of his prayer is this. "You've tricked me, Lord! You never told me it would be this way."

"I'm your prophet I am supposed to be honoured, not ridiculed! Why is this happening? It's just not fair!" But is that true, did God trick Jeremiah? Of course not.

If you cast your mind back to the first week when we looked at Jeremiah's calling in chapter 1. You'll remember that Jeremiah was given fair warning.

Twice Jeremiah is to not to fear what people will do to him, twice he is reassured that God will be with and will rescue him. And twice he is commanded to go where he is sent and to speak what he is given.

Jeremiah primary concern seems to be ‘success’, and not seeing it in any worldly terms, he lays the blame at God's door. But God's primary concern for Jeremiah is not successfulness, but faithfulness.

As 21st Century Christian, this is something we need to come to terms with too. God's purpose for our lives is not to make us successful, or even happy. God's primary purpose for our lives is to make us faithful followers of Jesus.

If we make success or anything else our mark of God's will for our lives then when suffering comes, like Jeremiah, we'll feel the temptation to lay the blame at God's feet.

But if we make faithfulness our mark of God's will, when suffering comes we'll lay our lives at his feet and trust him to provide what we need to carry on.

The same is true for our congregation. God's desire for the Ashford congregational church is not to make us successful in the eyes of the world.

Big budget, a huge congregation, laser light show, and hipster preachers in check shirts… well, maybe not that last one…
God’s will is to make us a church full of faithful followers of Jesus.

-   Faithful in preaching the bible - even the bits we might not want to hear.
-   Faithful in living according to his requirements of us - even the ones we might not want to follow.
-   Faithful in believing that Jesus is the only hope for our dying world - even when it is unpopular.

If we don't when it appears things are not on the up for for us, we'll be tempted to lay the blame at God's feet, rather than laying our church at his feet and trusting that he will build his kingdom come what may.

> Seeing God's will for us being faithful to Jesus doesn't make the burden of faithfulness any lighter. Often it makes life harder. Like Jeremiah, there will be times when we feel we are constantly swimming against the flow of the people around us.

They'll be times when our message will bring us ridicule and mockery and causes people to whisper behind our backs. But remember, we've had fair warning, Jesus says in **John 15:18**, _"If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first."_

The point is this: when we recognise that God's purpose for us is to make us faithful followers of Jesus it changes how we approach suffering in the first place. When Like Jeremiah we find ourselves in the spiritual valley, we can be confident that God is not our enemy, he has not duped us like some email scammer.

Instead we trust that he will use this time to grow us in our faithfulness to our saviour Jesus by providing us with all the resources we need to make it to the very end. Following Jesus is hard and the burden of faithfulness is heavy, but God's goal for us is not to give us an easy life, or even a happy life, but a faithful one.

## 2. Up on the Mountain (20:11-13) (996 words)

Having walked with Jeremiah in the valley, we now join him on the spiritual mountain t

> When Abi and I were in our final year of university, we had the opportunity to do a work placement with a church in Hawaii. As you can imagine, when we weren't working we spent as much time as we could at the beach. And one thing I'll never forget about those beach trips was the waves.
>
> In Waikiki, the waves were pretty pathetic - like Newquay on a good day - but cross the island and go to the north shore and the waves could reach well over 10 meters, that's about 30 feet in old money.
>
> But it wasn't just the size that was impressive, it was the power and the frequency. On many of the beaches, the next wave comes in before the one before it has finished breaking.
>
> A wave can hit at say waist height and then moments later another to crash into your shoulders knocking you over. You really had to be on your toes.
>
> In many ways, the feelings that hit a person as they go through suffering can be like those waves in Hawaii. Some feelings are quite ordinary, their size and intensity is very similar to what we are used to normally.
>
> Others can seem so hugely overwhelming that we want to do nothing other than get out of the water as quickly as possible. Other emotions ride in on the crest of another catching us completely by surprise.

As Jeremiah pours out his suffering to God in his complaints, his various emotions crash out of him like Hawaiian waves. Each one is different in size, shape, force, and intensity. And that's certainly true of v11-13.

In the previous section, Jeremiah speaks as if God is his enemy and yet now it seems he has realised that God is his only hope against his enemies. The change is fast, unexpected and jarring. But remember, in this moment, Jeremiah is not acting like Paul carefully and rationally recording his thoughts in an orderly way.

> This is Jeremiah painfully and truthful recording his emotions, what he _feels_. And right now, he feels like praising God.

The first thing he praises God for is his protection. Up until this point, Jeremiah has felt like a soldier wounded by friendly fire. Face down in the dust, betrayed by the one he thought would protect him.

But now he gains a new perspective. As lifts himself out of the dirt he realises that the Lord has not shot him in the ack, but is actually standing guard over him. The people plot and scheme against Jeremiah, but they will not win the day, the Lord will.

Secondly, having recognised the Lord's protection over him moves from praise to prayer. Not satisfied with his enemies failing in their plans, Jeremiah longs to see God's judgement fall upon them.

> The bible is clear that all who refuse to trust in Jesus will one day stand before him and face his justice for their sins. One day everyone wrong will be righted, and every injustice will be purged from God's creation. But sometimes God, in his goodness, brings a foretaste of that justice in the here and now.

And this is what Jeremiah is asking God to do. His prayer isn't the prayer of a bitter man asking for God to hurt those who hurt him; it is a request for justice from a man who has been falsely imprisoned.

In the end, having committed himself to God's plans and purposes, Jeremiah's feelings well up and out of himself in song. It is strong language in v13 when he says "sing to the Lord!" the word 'sing' is a command word.

> It is like he is saying to himself, "you will sing Jeremiah, because regardless of what you are feeling right now God is still worthy of your praise."

He even tells us at the end of v13 why he feels this strongly, because God is his certain hope. One who can be trusted "to rescue the needy from the hands of the wicked."

> In 'A Grief Observed' C.S. Lewis wrote honestly about times when his suffering caused him to doubt God's character. At one point he compares God to a mad scientist, who uses suffering to spiritually dissect people whilst they're still alive.
>
> But by the end of the book, Lewis rejects these ideas, not only because they robbed him of comfort but also because they were not true and so also robbed him of hope.

Faithfully following Jesus is hard. And at sometimes the burden of faithfulness can feel like crushing weight. At those times we need to remember that we need a hope that goes beyond this life. a hope that is grounded in what is true. We need to lift our faces from dirt and see the that Lord stands over us like a mighty warrior.

Sometimes he may allow a glancing blow to knock us to the ground, but he will not let our enemies move in for the kill. No, he is utterly dependable, utterly faithful, and completely able to meet our need.

He has already fended off our three greatest enemies - Satan, sin, and death. Enemies which through Jesus death and resurrection are already defeated and will one day be removed from our lives forever. That alone makes him worthy of praise regardless of how we might be feeling.

> When faithfully following Jesus is hard, and when the burden of faithfulness feels too heavy to carry, we need to remember, that like Jeremiah, we have a God we can depend on. A God to whom to whom we can commit our causes.
>
> A God on whom we can rely on to rescue our needy bodies and souls through the death and resurrection of our Lord and saviour, Jesus Christ. A God who is big enough to move us to worship.

## 3. Over the Edge (20:14-18)

Finally, Jeremiah goes over the edge.

> In an excellent sermon on suffering, American pastor Matt Chandler begins by telling the story of a perfect Saturday with his family. They got up early and watched some TV, they went swimming at the local pool the kids were blue and wrinkly.
>
> They had lunch together, they enjoyed each others company. And through it all, he comments on how he felt God give him the rest and peace that he needed. And then that evening, the phone rings.
>
> It's an old school friend called Jeff. But Jeff is not calling to catch up. No, Jeff's calling because his six-year-old daughter has just been diagnosed with terminal cancer.
>
> Reflecting on that phone call, Matt points out, that even though he had all of his theological ducks in a row – he knew what the bible said about God and suffering - somehow wasn't enough.
>
> Faced with the family's pain and suffering, his heart struggled to believe about God what his mind knew to be true.
>
> It seems to me, that in these final verses, Jeremiah is experiencing something similar. He's come so far. He begins by blaming God for his problems and then has this incredible encounter with his almighty protector and saviour in the middle.
>
> And if only it ended there. I could finish with a prayer and we could blet out all five verses of "And Can it Be" and go home feeling great. But our passage is not like that. And often life is not like that either.

In these final verses, it seems as if Jeremiah's heart is struggling to process what his mind now knows to be true. And as a result, his prayer ends with a bleaker outlook than it began.

Essentially Jeremiah wants a do-over. He's not really calling down curses on his birthday or on the poor messenger who delivered the happy news. Again this isn't carefully considered thought, it is the overflow of a suffering heart.

Jeremiah's language doesn't invite us to critically unpick his thought process, it invites us to feel what he feels. To feel his agony and his despair at his situation. He is a prophet given a message of Judgement for a people who won't listen and bring him only misery.

And since that ministry began before he was born, the only way out of it he can see is if he had never been born at all. Jeremiah is not throwing in the towel; he is throwing up his arms in a cry for help.

Finally, his feelings come to a head in verse 18 when we he cries out "why did I ever come out of the womb to see trouble and sorrow and to end my days in shame?"

-   Jeremiah dispairs that he was even born.
-   he pities his own miserable existence.
-   he struggles to see meaning and purposes in his suffering.
-   He finds it hard to hold on to hope when all around him seems so bleak.

> But perhaps what underlines the pain that Jeremiah expresses in his final question is that it goes unanswered. The verse ends, the chapter concludes, and the scene changes. God does not reply; Jeremiah gets no answer. Consider that for a moment.

It is an important observation because it shows that God did not want or need to answer it. This might sound crass at first but think about it. The bible is God's book, he is both author and editor. If he did not provide a answer for us it is because God does not feel that he needs to provide one.

Instead, we are to settle for knowing how the story ends, that one day, as Revelation 21:4 promises, _"God will wipe every tear from {our} eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away.”_

Faithfully following Jesus is hard. And sometimes, like Jeremiah, the burden of faithfulness can feel heavier for what seems like a lack of answers.

At those times it is important that we remind ourselves that what we need to be faithful is not having a working knowledge of the facts behind this or that experience of suffering. But rather a working knowledge of God's character and promises revealed to us in the bible.

In times of suffering it is these truths that the Holy Spirit will use to comfort and sustain us through difficult times. Our questions in the short term might go unanswered. but we know what Jesus has done in dying for our sins and rising in victory over death,

and we know how the story ends. With pain, loss, suffering, illness, death, and injustice swept from this world as it is made new for us, forever. Faithfully following Jesus is hard, and it is made harder, sometimes for lack of answers, but more often by forgetting to look back to the cross and forward to eternity.

## Conclusion (346 words)

> So let's be clear on something as we end. If you live long enough you will experience suffering. And suffering is not a gentleman. It does not call ahead or give fair warning.

>
> And let's be clear on something eles. Faithfully Following Jesus is hard and the burdern of faithfulness is heavy.

Jeremiah knew this reality. No doubt all of us here today know it too. There is someone else who was keenly aware of the reality of suffering: the Lord Jesus.

> Have you ever wondered, how was it that Jesus was able to experience such incredile suffering and still keep going? How come when faced with betrayal, rejection, injustice, torture, cruxifiction, the wrath of God, and then death...
>
> and still he chose the faithful life over the easy life? Why was a faithful life fair more important to him than a happy or successful one?

The New Testament gives us lots of ways to answer that question, but having looked at Jeremiah's prayer today, pershaps the most helpful answer is found in **Hebrews 12:2** where we are told that it is because of the _"the joy set before him,"_ that Jesus _"endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God."_

Jesus chose a faithful life over anything else because it offered a better reward. He knew that what his Father had in store for him if he was faithful to the end was better than anything he could find down here. And what is true for him, is true for us too!

> Look, following faithfully is hard. Jeremiah knew we know it, and Jesus knew it. Sometimes faithfulness feels like a burden that is going to crush us. And in those times it is easy to feel tempted to give up. Chances are we've all felt that pull at one time or another.
>
> But remember, Jesus knows what we are going through, he has experienced it and worse... And Through the Holy Spirit he draws alongside us and gently says...
>
> "I know it hard. I know it is heavy. I've carried that burden of faithfulness all the way to cross. But you know what, I've seen the prize that is waiting for you. And it is even better than anything this world can offer you! Come on, we can do this, we'll do it together."\*\*

**Faithfully following Jesus is hard and the burden of faithfulness is heavy.** Jeremiah knew - we know it. The good news is that Jesus knows it too and he is both willing and able to carry it with us... all we need to do is let him.

Let's pray.
