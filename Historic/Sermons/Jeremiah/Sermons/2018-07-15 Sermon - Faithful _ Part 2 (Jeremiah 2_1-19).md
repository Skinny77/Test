# Sermon - Faithful - Part 2 \_ Drinking from the Toilet Bowl

# Introduction

> In a ordinary town, a child is born. His mother was a committed Christian but his dad could not care less. Growing up the boy was always in trouble.
>
> At university he turned his back on Christianity for a uni life of parties, sex, and casual drugs. 

> After graduating he was offered the chance further study at a prestigious inner city university. His mum begged him not to go. And although he promised her he would stay, he left in secret the next morning.
>
> At around 30 he became a lecturer. He moved in with his girlfriend, had a child but never married. He attended church a couple for a while. He made several efforts to find meaning and direction, but nothing stuck for long, and nothing fulfilled him either.
>
> Then one day he’s sat in the park, the Bible on his lap. And he hears what sounds like a child say, "Pick it up! Read it!" For reasons he couldn't explain he picked it up, he read it and put his trust in Christ.
>
> It is a familiar story isn't? A child grows up, abandons his parent's faith in university only to rediscover it later in life. It seems that something never change, because this is the story of North-African theologian Augustine of Hippo who lived some 1,700 years ago.
>
> As an old man, Augustine looked back on his life and saw in his young self himself a restless heart that drove him away from God to look for what he needed in all the wrong places. In his autobiography, he wrote, "Lord you have made us for yourself and our hearts are restless until they rest in you."

**This restless drive to seek in the world what can only be found in God is what the Bible calls idolatry.  And that is exactly what God accuses the people of doing in our passage today.**

If you've been here for a while then no doubt you've heard sermons on idolatry before. You may already know that anything can be an idol: money, career, pleasure, comfort, self-image, control and even family. 

But how can we know if you we worshipping one ourselves? Because there is an important difference between knowing about a killer disease, and knowing whether you have the symptoms of one...

Well like an ancient near-eastern version of NHS Direct, Jeremiah gives us some questions to help diagnose our condition and even some advice on an effective treatment plan.

Three questions:

    1. Have you forgotten the gospel? (v1-8)
    2. Are you feeling dissatisfied? (v9-13)
    3. Where are you looking for security? (v14-19)

As we explore these questions together, we are going to see that just like Augustine all those years ago that **God has made us for himself, and our hearts are restless until they rest in him**. {Repeat}

# 1. Have you forgotten the gospel? (v1-8)

First question, have you forgotten the gospel? {SLIDE}

> On Monday Abi and I celebrated our 7th wedding anniversary. On Saturday 9th July 2011 at Glenwood Community Church in Cardiff, we committed to our lives to one another. Thinking back to our wedding reminds me os the many reasons why I married Abi in the first place. Reasons why I still love being married 7 years later.
>
> But I don't always remember… and when forget I don't always give her the time and energy she deserves. Instead, it goes on things like work, friends, and hobbies. 

> It isn't that any of those things are bad. It just that they are not as important to me as my marriage. I can get another job, I can make new friends, I find other hobbies. What I can't find, is another Abi.

In Chapter 2:1 God sends Jeremiah to Jerusalem to bring his charges against the people, to call them to repentance, and to warn them of the consequences if they do not. These sermons are recorded in the first six chapters of Jeremiah. But you'll notice, that our passage begins in v1-2 with a word picture. A picture of a marriage.

When God first rescued his people from Egypt and led them to the promised land they were like newlyweds. Sure they had some hiccups on the way but God and his people were devoted to each other. And like a good husband, the Lord protected and provided for his people.

But it wasn't to last. In V5 God asks them _'What fault did you fathers find in me, that they strayed so far from me?'_ Answer: None. Instead, they strayed from him because their restless hearts drove them to idols. They forgot what God had done in saving them. Rather than trusting that the Lord would continue to save them, they start trusting idols to do it for them. In short, they forgot the gospel.

Here's the thing, idol worship whether in the 6th century BC or 21st Century AD is basically the same. People didn't sacrifice to idol gods like Baal because Baal was such a stand-up god. But because they believed that Baal would deliver the goods. God promises that he will provide all they _needed_ if we trusted him to. But idols promises to provide them with all they _wanted_.

We might not bow down before a statue of Baal but we still have our idols. Suspicious of God's promise that he will provide all that we _need_  our restless hearts still drive us to seek the thing we _want_. So we sacrifice our children to our careers, our marriages to personal fulfilment, our physical and mental health to our children's wellbeing. Thinking that we'll get what we want, not just what we need.

And the consequences of this spiritual consumerism are massive. v5 says that "the people followed worthless idols and become worthless themselves" You see, Israel was incredibly valuable to God, as God chosen people they were his firstfruits. **IN the same way that an appetiser at a restaurant gives you an idea of what to look forward to when the main course arrives.** Israel was to be a picture of what it would like to be God's people when God's salvation plan came to fulfilment in Jesus.

But when they began to follow the idols of the people all around them, they became like the people all around them. They could no longer give people a taste of what God's salvation looked like because they look just like everyone else.

**It's not hard to see the application for us today, is it?** on one level will always be of incredibly valuable to God, he sent his only son to die for our sins in our place. Our salvation was purchased at a high price. But God did not buy us back to let us go about lives however we like.

Like Israel we are to show the world what it looks like to be God's people. **But whilst Israel was the first fruits; we are the harvest. They were they appetiser, we're the main course.** If as God's people we are all running after the same idols as everyone else, our lives are lives become a pretty worthless advert for the gospel. 

AS Jesus says in Mt 5:13, _"what good is salt that is no longer salty?"_ If we deny with our lives what we affirm with our words, what good are we?

Having outlined the consequences for us, v6-8 give us some helpful signs that we may have forgotten the gospel. Things like:

-   spiritual complacency
-   selfishness
-   spiritual laziness
-   a lack of humility
-   a lack teachability
-   and an attraction to false teaching.

If one or more of those qualities describe you or me, then we have forgotten the gospel and exchanged God for an idol.

The answer is to seek God out, to ask the Holy Spirit to reveal your idol to you and to help you give it up. To remember what God has done for us in sending Jesus to die and rise to rescue us from our idols. To worship him and thank him for it.

I'm not saying it won't be hard or painful, but it will be worth it. **Because God has made us for himself, and our hearts are restless until they rest in God.**

# 2. Are you feeling dissatisfied?

Second question are you feeling dissatisfied? {SLIDE}

In v9-12, the Lord lays out his charges again. You could search from East to West and not find a nation that's done what God's people have done. They've exchanged the God of glory for worthless idols. God says that not even the other nations would do something so foolish as to change gods this way and their gods don't even exist!

> In v13 he says that Judah's sinful idolatry is like a foolish farmer who discovers a beautiful spring of fresh clean water but decides it can't be trusted, so digs a dirty pit to collect rainwater and runoff instead. The farmer tries to seal it with clay, but the clay's cracked and the water keeps leaking out.
>
> It would be like coming in from an afternoon in the hot sun, and saying "You know what, I don't think I can trust the tap water... I'm going to go drink from the toilet bowl instead." In the same way, the people rejected the one source of guaranteed satisfaction (God) for the one thing that is bound to disappoint them (idols).

Thinking about this passage it strikes me that those of us who are looking for satisfaction in the gifts God gives us rather than in God himself fall into three categories. Those who are chasing it, those who think they've got it, and those who think they lost it. Let me explain.

## A. Those who are chasing it

Firstly, those who are chasing it. {SLIDE}

> I met up with an old friend the other day. He was telling me about his great job in the city, his upcoming wedding, his new house, his spiritual explorations... Then he looked at me and said: "What is it about Christianity that gives you such purpose and direction?" 

> Life had worked out well for my friend, I was happy for him. But his question revealed that despite all that he had, something was still missing. He was dissatisfied and searching for answers.

Maybe you can relate to that, on paper you've got it all and yet something is missing. But you know you'll find it if you only keep looking. When the house keys are in my hand; when I finally retire; when I hold the baby in my arms; when I finally get my promotion - then, then I'll be satisfied.

You might be for a little while, but not forever. That kind of lasting satisfaction is found not meant to be found in created things but in the creator God.

## B. Those who think they've found it

Secondly, those who think they've found it. {SLIDE}

> The conversation goes something like this. "of course, without Jesus, your not happy are you?" the Christian says. "no, I am", the non-Christian replies. "Yea, but not really fulfilled are you?" "uh... yep, pretty fulfilled thanks." "yes, but if you're honest..." And on it goes. 

> Perhaps you're sitting here this morning thinking, this sounds like a big fuss about nothing. I'm happy, I'm fulfilled. So what if I live for work, or my family, or my spouse. Big deal. Sure Jesus make might make life better, but things are pretty good already.

If that's you, you need to know that you are playing on borrowed time. The things you are building your life and satisfaction upon where never meant to take that kind of pressure. The things of this world are supposed to be means to an end, not an end in themselves. 

We enjoy what we have best when we find ultimate enjoyment in Jesus Christ. He's the only thing in this life that is secure and unchanging and so is the only secure anchor for our satisfaction. When our comfortable life is turned upside down. What then? If we're not anchored to Christ, then we're cut adrift in a ocean of disappointment.

## C. Those who think they've lost it

Lastly, Those who think they've lost it {SLIDE}

> In 2010 British author, Zadie Smith said, "Resign yourself to the lifelong sadness that comes from never being satisfied." Never satisfied? Really? Wow, that's bleak... Or is it? Maybe you agree with Zadie Smith. Maybe you've spent your life searching for lasting satisfaction and never found. It's like the mythical unicorn - uncatchable.

Maybe you knew some satisfaction once but now it is gone. A marriage collapsed, a child let you down, a job or your health was taken from you. And now you sneer at others who look happier than you and shake your fist at heaven. 
But is it God's fault when our pursuit of satisfaction in the world fails to produce the goods? Jesus did not die to make our idols work for us, he died to rescue us from them and their eternal consequences. Ask yourself, have you placed an expectation on God that he‘s never promised to meet?

* * *

In all three examples, the people have been looking for lasting satisfaction in the wrong place. The first person The first thinks they'll find it, then second thinks they have it, the third think they've lost it.

If you are too busy chasing what you think will bring you satisfaction, if you can't see your own need for Jesus, or if you're to bitter to bother with him beyond the bare minimum. Then like the people of Judah all those years ago, you've most likely exchanged the God of glory for a worthless idol.

**Yet the irony of the gospel is that only when turn from our quest for worldly satisfaction and to Jesus for forgiveness do we discover what we are looking for.** Or in the language of Jeremiah 2:13, we have to stop digging our dirty cisterns before we can go and drink from the spring of living water. Once again we are reminded that **God has made us made us for himself and our heart are restless until they rest in him.**

# 3. Where are you looking for security? (v14-19)

Final question, where are you looking for security?

> I think we can all agree that Teresa May is having a pretty tough time right now. There's been a lot of uncertainty around how Brexit will unfold and I'm sure she hoped that the plan she agreed at Chequers would help answer some of that uncertainty. Instead, factions of her party are up in arms and she as seen five embarrassing resignations.
>
> And as if to make things worse, Donald Trump can't make up his mind about what he wants. I feel for her. In her shoes, I'd feel stuck between a rock and a hard place.

In Jeremiah's day, the people had their own share of political uncertainty too. The heady day's of David and Solomon when the united kingdom was long gone. And since the Northern kingdom of Isreal had been swept away by the Assyrians in 722BC, the southern kingdom of Judah was, politically speaking, stuck between a rock and hard place. 

Egypt in the South; Assyria, later, Babylon in the North. Over Jeremiah's forty year ministry Judah would jump from alliances with one superpower to another in desperate pursuit of security.

But there was a problem. In Jeremiah's day, religion and politics were closely linked. A nation couldn't commit themselves to another without also committing themselves to that nations god. But God's people were supposed to be different. Their political independence was supposed to be a picture of their spiritual dependence on the Lord. God's people were to find their security both individually and as a nation in their God. But they refused to do it.

v14-16 remind the people of two significant battles. The first, the invasion of the Northern Kingdom by the Assyrians in 722 BC which saw the people of the north taken away as slaves. The second is the Battle of Megiddo when King Josiah of Judah was killed by the Egyptian's in 609 BC. 

This is followed up by a question v17 "Have you not brought this on yourselves by forsaking the LORD your God?" Answer: yes. Yes, they have. Both battles were a result of them rejecting God and his rule.

Now God hammers home his point with a question about two rivers. And like last week, the footnotes give us what we need to understand the God's words. The Shihor refers to the Nile in Egypt and the River is the river Euphrates in Assyria. 

In the Ancient world, big centres of power often sprung up around rivers. They offered food, water, travel, trade. They offered security. So when God asks, them about drinking from the Nile and the Euphrates, he's saying _"look how these nations have treated you in the past, do you really think they offer last security for the future?"_

_"no Your own wickedness in forsaking me, and chasing them will punish you"._ God says. It's another eerie warning of future judgement. Ultimately, God would use the Babylonians as his agents of judgement on Judah. But in the earthly scheme of things, the Babylonians would come down on Judah because of her political flip-flopping between one superpower and another.

Just as Judah couldn't decide who to worship, she couldn't decide to allay her with either, in the end, paid the ultimate price. It is a harsh reminder that our sins have both physical and spiritual consequences. And that consequence is death and eternal judgement.

So take a moment, ask yourself the question: Where are you looking for security?

-   Maybe it's in **politics**, the right party or people in power and you'll get the life you always dreamed of.
-   Perhaps it's in **your work** or **your money** - a couple more years, one more promotion and we'll be set for life.
-   Maybe its **property** or **that nest egg** your got tucked away that you think will deliver safety and financial independence?
-   Maybe it is in what**your spouse, or your kids ** think of you…

Whatever it is it cannot provide you with the security you are looking for. Sure they can provide a measure of security, but again - what happens when life is turned upside down?

-   What if, like **Job**, those things are all taken from you in a flash of ill health or personal tragedy? What then?
-   Maybe you think **you're a strong and capable person, your smart** you'll make do somehow. What if your mind is taken from you or your own thoughts turn against you?

> **Then there is the ultimate test of our security.** When death stares us in the eye, will our work, our home, our money, or intelligence offer us a secure hope that we'll be delivered from this life to a better place? Of course, they won't.

Death takes us from this world, which means that nothing in this world can offer us security in the face of death. We need something, or better yet, someone who is not of this world, but who have experienced death and come out the other side. We need Jesus.

> In Revelation 22 John sees a vision of the New Creation were God's people will one day live for eternity. In his vision, he sees a city, and in the centre of the city is a throne on which the Lord Jesus is seated. And from under the throne follows the river of life.

The point of John's vision is that from King Jesus flows enteral life for all who all who call him king.

-   He died in our place and he paid for our sin so that death would have no claim on us.
-   He rose in victory and he conquered death for us.

He does not promise us an easy or comfortable life. But he does promise a security in the face of death that nothing in this world can offer us. The security of eternal life.

Lasting security, even in death, is not found by drinking from the rivers of this world, but by drinking from the river life in the world to come. ultimate security is found in the Lord Jesus our saviour, our creator, and our king. **Because he made us for himself, and our hearts are restless until they rest in him.**
