# Sermon - Faithful - Part 1 (Jeremiah 1_1-19)

## 0. Introduction: Why Bother with Jeremiah?

_In 1985, The New York Times ran an article about an advancement in technology that they were sure was doomed to fail. The article said:_

> On the whole, people don't want to lug a ... with them to the beach or on a train to while away hours they would rather spend reading the sports or business section of the newspaper.
>
> Somehow, the {Industry} has assumed that everyone would love to have a keyboard grafted on as an extension of their fingers. It just is not so.

What is the journalist describing?

**Answer: The Laptop Computer**.

This particular journalist _convinced_ beyond doubt a portable computer was destined for failure. It was a fad, a flash in the pan! At best any previous success was only an indicator that its best years were already behind it. No, no, it was best to move on now than to try an deny the inevitable. To suggest otherwise was utter foolishness.

Truth is many, today might say the same Christianity. Churches closing, congregations shrinking, whole generations missing. Sure Christianity had a good run, but past success is simply an indicator that we've had our day. To suggest otherwise is utter foolishness.

So sitting here this morning you might be forgiven for thinking "Why are we bothering with the book of Jeremiah?" A collection of ancient predictions about some ancient people who are nothing like me?

What does Jeremiah know about my struggles? About family breakdown, emotional heartache, and poor mental health? What does he know about church decline, spiritual doubts, and the pressures of being a faithful follower of Christ in 2018?

If that's what you're thinking you are in for a surprise. Because Jeremiah is a book whose central characters are a God whose heart breaks for the sin of his people even as his unimaginably slow building anger reaches boiling point.

And his prophet, Jeremiah, who struggles with unimaginable suffering and personal struggles as he seeks to be a faithful a voice among a people who think his messages sounds like utter foolishness.

But today particularly, we are going see to that **If we want to be faithful to Christ, we are going to look foolish to the world** {Repeat}

In our passage today that plays itself like this:

1.  A Messenger who feels foolish (v1-9)
2.  A Message that sounds foolish (v11-16)
3.  A Mission that looks foolish (v10, 17-19)

{Repeat}

## 1.  A Messenger who feels foolish (v1-9)

Before I started watching boxsets with Abi, I often used to skip episodes that I suspected were filler. You know, episodes that spent forty minutes explaining something that could've been done in three minutes of good dialogue.

Most of the time this wasn't a problem, but occasionally I miss a vital piece of information. Which meant that when a character was introduced three or four episodes later I had no idea who they were or why they were such a big deal. Often this meant going back to find which episode contained the missing information.

Jeremiah chapter 1 opens with a little historical summary. At first glance, it can read like filler 'Jeremiah son of some bloke, from some town, in some place, who lived during the reign of some kings.'

Boring! SKIP!!! Move on to v4 where the plot seems to get going a bit. But if we do that we are going to miss some information that's vital for understanding this book and this chapter.

You see the Holy Spirit includes these details, here at the beginning, to remind us that we are dealing with historical person. So when we look at the later part, this first part tell important.

Jeremiah's encounter with the LORD isn't simply a spiritual event, but also a historical one. Something that actually happened. When Jeremiah says in v4 "the word of the Lord came to me" he is giving us a window into a personal encounter he had with the Living God in 627 BC.

And when we look at God's encounter with Jeremiah we notice that this is a dialogue. The Lord speaks and Jeremiah replies. The other thing we notice is that it is the Lord who take the initiative with Jeremiah.

V4 doesn't say that Jeremiah sought out the word of the Lord, but instead that the Word sought out Jeremiah. This encounter might have taken Jeremiah by surprise but not the Lord.  God had planned it all long... before Jeremiah even was born.

Take a look at those four actions words in verse 5. Look at the way they build off each other and develop: **I formed you, I knew you, I set up you, I appointed you.**

It's as if the Lord says to Jeremiah, _"Son, I've had my eye on you since before you were a twinkle in your daddy's eye. I've made you like one of those objects in the temple that can only be used in service of me._

_You're my megaphone, Jeremiah, my messenger to Jerusalem, Judah, Samaria, and the ends of the earth." It's incredible language._

Jeremiah's reply then is not so surprising either. Far from saying in v6 "when do we get started Lord?" **he tells the all-knowing creator of the universe that God has made a mistake.**

Jeremiah's objection falls into two broad categories: he's the wrong age and he lacks experience.

In defence of Jeremiah, when he says that he is a just child, he uses a Hebrew word that often describes a boy between the ages of 7 and 14. Jeremiah really is a kid when the Lord's first calls him.

And no doubt to a young boy living in a backwater town like Anathoth, the thought of being God's messenger boy to the nations likely terrified the pants off him.

So when Jeremiah complains that he can't speak... he's saying "I don't know how to speak like a prophet. What if I make a fool of myself?"

Faced with this enormous task, Jeremiah feels foolishly inadequate for the job God has for him. He cannot see in himself, what the Lord sees. Surely God's made a mistake.

But the LORD doesn't make mistakes, as he gently and gracious reminds the young boy in v7-9. There Lord reminds him and us, that our God is far bigger and stronger than our doubts.

As the final assurance that Jeremiah's age and experience are irrelevant in this matter. The he Lord promises that his presence, the Holy Spirit, will be with Jeremiah every step of the way.

As a proof, he gives him a sign. he touches the boy's mouth - from now on he will give Jeremiah the words say. It is a beautiful picture, as the God of universe stoops down to calm the fears of a young boy. Such gentleness, such patience, such grace...

**So often Jeremiah's fears are our own fears too, aren't they?** The time's not right Lord, or I don't know how Lord. What if I make a mistake? Are you sure haven't got the wrong person?

As God promised Jeremiah that God’s word and God’s Spirit would always be with him. So we too carry God’s Word, the Bible, in our hands and the God’s Spirit, the Holy Spirit, in our hearts. Knowing with full assurance that where the Word of the Lord is heard, there the Spirit of the Lord at work. You see you **God's not looking for perfect messengers; just willing ones.**

Using a child to bring a nation to its knees; using us, his people, to spread the gospel. To many it sounds like utter foolishness. May even may feel like fools ourselves. But remember **Being faithful to Christ means looking foolish to the world.**

## 2. The Message Sounds Foolish

Second, the message sounds foolish.

_The name Harold Camping doesn't mean much now. But back in early 2011 was all over the news as the California Bible teacher who famously predicted the end of the world... three times._

_The secret to Camping's predictions was that he claimed to have discovered secret mathematical codes hidden in the bible. So if one could find the this hidden and crunch the numbers, they could predict the day of Jesus' return. Three times Harold made a prediction, three times he was wrong._

What Harold Camping didn't realise is that the trick to understanding Bible prophecy is that there are no hidden codes. And most importantly, **the Bible nearly always gives what we need to understand what it says.**

Let's look at these verses together and you'll see what I mean. In verses 11-16, the Lord outlines Jeremiah's message with two visual illustrations. **An almond branch and a boiling pot.**

In the first vision the Lord asks Jeremiah "what do you see?". "An Almond branch" Jeremiah replies. And the Lord says "You have seen correctly for I am watching to see that my word is fulfilled".

At first this vision seems strange. "What on earth does an old stick have to do with God's word?" If you have a red church bible in front of you you'll see a clue in the footnote on v12: The Hebrew words for almond and watch sound alike. Through this visual illustration, God is once again reassuring his prophet.

The vision's purpose is to give Jeremiah confidence during his long ministry. The Lord _will_ bring his purposes to pass, and what his prophet speaks _will_ happen.

Even the choice of tree is no coincidence. Jeremiah's hometown of Anathoth was and still is famous for its Almond groves. So as Jeremiah grew up, and whenever he returned home, and saw those almond trees he would be reminded of God's promise to him. Again this is a picture of God's wonderful gentleness and patience with his people

The next image, the boiling pot, represent what will be at heart of Jeremiah's message. **Like a bot on the stove that's ignored eventually boils over. So the Lord's anger against his people has been slowly building for generations and is now about to boil over in judgement**.

That judgement will take the form of an invasion from the North. An army will come and conqueror Judah's capital, invade her towns, and and carry her people into exile. This is what Jeremiah will proclaim to the people and this will be the sign of that the Lord's judgement has come.

For almost half the book the identity of this nation is a mystery. But the reference to the exile in Chapter 1:3 is a big clue! Forty years after Jeremiah's first encounter with God, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon came and invaded Judah. He sacked Jerusalem conquered her towns and took all but weakest and poorest people off into exile in Babylon.

The identity of the northern invaders might be a secret in v14-15, but the reason that the Lord will exile them is not. He spells it out loud and clear for Jeremiah in v16. **The Lord God tells Jeremiah that this judgement will come upon his chosen people because they have consistently and deliberately turned their back on him.** Worshipping false gods and created objects rather than the creator God.

**That might sound strange at first**. But over the coming weeks, we going to see how in the end the judgement the Lord promised for Judah was inevitable and unavoidable. And especially next week, we'll begin to get a flavour for the seriousness of idolatry and its consequences for us and the world we live in.

For now, **I simply want us to see how foolish this message sounds**. Imagine you were one of Jeremiah's first listeners. _"SOrry Jeremiah, you're saying that God is going to punish our entire nation because I lit a joss stick and put by a statue on my mantlepiece?"_ It sounds like craziness.

But when you think about it. **Is Jeremiah's message any less foolish sounding than ours?** As Christians, we are convinced that the human race is headed for a universe day of judgement. And people's only hope is to put their trust in a Galilean rabbi called Jesus, who died on a cross and came back to life again. A man we believe to be God himself come as a human to call everyone everywhere to turn from sin and trust in him.

Of course, we're rigbt to believe as we do. God has told us in his word that this is so and history supports it. But I hope you can see why, to so many, our message sounds like utter foolishness?

But this is no accident. **Our message sounds foolish because this is how God wants it to sound**. Paul puts it this way 1 Corinthians 1:18, he says that

> "the message of the Cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God."

Like Jeremiah, our message sounds foolishness to a world that has turned its back on God. And yet that is the message that God calls us to faithfully share with those around us. And it is that message which is the only hope for our world.

Some will, by God's grace, will see our message for what it is and be saved.  But many will ignore it and misunderstand it; mocking both message and messenger alike. But like Jeremiah, God  hasn't called us to worry about the results of the message. But simply to be faithful in proclaiming the message. Knowing full well, that like Jeremiah, **being faithful to Christ, will mean looking foolish to the world.**

## A Mission that Looks Foolish

So picture the scene with me your in your car heading home. You've just picked up your ten-year-old son from school. "how was your day?" you ask.

"Fine" They reply.

"Anything interesting happen today?"

"Ummm. I found an almond branch in the playground and then pot boiled over in the school canteen."

"Oh really... That’s nice dear"

"Yep, and now I need you to take me to a BBC newsroom."

"Um why?"

"because I have a message from God. If the nation doesn't turn back to him then the Russians are going to invade and burn down the houses of parliament!"

Shocked pause. "uh and did God say when this invasion was going to take place?"

"In about 2058 - so we've got to hurry!"

As bizarre as that conversation sounds, that is pretty much the mission God gives to young Jeremiah. **Warn them of coming judgement and call them back to me.**

Look at v10, God tells Jeremiah that his mission would be more about judgement than hope. But it would still contain some hope. Through this judgement, God would still work to rebuild and replant his people. Even if most of that building and planting wouldn't begin until the people were already in Babylon.

It was a hard mission Lord called him to. For most of his forty year career, Jeremiah was accused of being a liar, a false prophet, a traitor, a deserter, and conspiring with foreign powers. And even when Babylon was at the door, and his prophecies were being fulfilled, still the people and their rulers would not listen to God and his prophet.

Jeremiah was imprisoned, put in public stocks, and even thrown down a well and left to die. His mission was opposed by the people, the priests, false prophets, and kings. Even those from his hometown of Anathoth tried to have him killed.

On top of the burden of his mission, he was often burdened by his own doubts and depression. In the end, Jeremiah would die alone and opposed in Egypt - the very last place he wanted to be.

Given all that Jeremiah would face as he grew into his mission, it makes sense that his encounter with God would end in v17-19 with both a charge and a promise.

Jeremiah's charge in v 17 has three parts. Jeremiah is to prepare himself for what lies ahead like a soldier prepares for war. He is to only speak what the Lord tells him to speak. And he is to fear offending his God more than he fears offending the people.

**For many of us, it's that last part Jeremiah's charge which is the hardest**. We know in theory that the answer to fear in evangelism is to fear offending God more than offending the world. But often it is much harder in pracrice. At times Jeremiah seemed to know implicitly how to fear the Lord more than people, at other times he would have to learn it the hard way.

The Lord knows that the road ahead will be hard for Jeremiah, so he follows up the charge with a promise. In v18-19, God promises to keep Jeremiah as secure as a fortified city, as strong as an iron pillar, and as immovable as a bronze wall. But notice that this is not a promise of an easy life, God never makes that promise to anyone.

**Like us, Jeremiah is called to live a cross-shaped life, marked by perseverance and self-denial.** And even though people fight against him they would never overcome him - Through Jeremiah, God would always have the last word.

**Many would consider it utterly foolish to put such huge expectations on a child so young**. Surely the weight of the task will crush him, he is bound to give up. And on occasion Jeremiah almost did. But he is God's prophet, his words are God's words, and where God's word is, there the Holy Spirit is too. **God's presence would go with God's prophet to guide and protect his faith every step of the way.**

When we consider all that Jeremiah will endure throughout his life it is hard not to think of Jesus. Misunderstood by rulers, opposed by the religious establishment, and rejected by his own people. Along with all the might of Satan himself, they fought against him and for a time it looked like the succeeded. They hung him on a cross, left him to die, and then sealed his body in a tomb.

But Jesus was adamant from the beginning that as foolish as it sounded this was his mission from the start. His death would pay the price for our sin and bring life and hope to his people. As foolish as the cross looked, it wasn't the end. Jesus rose again in victory three days later, breaking the curse of death and securing eternal life of us, forever.

And **in Matthew 28:16-20 Jesus gives us, his people, a mission, to share this news with everyone everywhere.** To go and tell what he has done and why people need to turn from sin and trust in him. And Like Jeremiah's mission, many consider our mission a fools errand.

But Jesus promises us that he will be with his people through the good times and the bad... even to the very end of the age. He knows it won't always be easy. Becasus **Jesus know better than anyone, that being faithful to the mission, means looking foolish to the world**.

## Playing the fool?

Why do I feel so inadequate for the task God has for me? I believe God's word is just that, God’s word, but why do some many think it is foolishness? Why do people think I ’m on a fool's errand?

As we move through Jeremiah, we going to see plenty of times when the prophet might have asked these same questions himself. And like him, there are plenty of times when we could be left wrestling with these questions too. Especially, when, like in Jeremiah's day and ours, people seem to be moving away from God faster and than they are moving towards him.

So what's the answer? What is the secret of being faithful, to being people who are always following Christ? What clues does Jeremiah 1:1-19 give us?

Looking at this chapter it would be all too easy to say that like Jeremiah we need to stand up and be ready. To not make excuse s for our feelings of weakness but to be prepared to say whatever the Lord calls us to say, and willing to go where ever he calls us to go.

To fear God more than we fear human beings. We need to become a church that is as secure as a fortress, strong as an iron pillar, and unmoving in our beliefs as a bronze wall. {Pause}

Maybe there is some truth there but it forgets something important.

The lesson Jeremiah was to take from this encounter was not to simply pull his socks up and try harder - that way ultimately leads to ruin and disappoint. No, **the lesson we need to learn from Jeremiah today is that being faithful _to_ God means trusting in the faithfulness _of_ God.**

-   A God who has sworn that he will be on watch to ensure that his word fulfils his purposes in our lives through Jesus death a resurrection.

-   A God who has sworn to give us the words to say when we need them most, just as he did for Jeremiah.

-   And a God who has sworn that whenever we go, and whatever we do, we don’t need to fear what humans can do to us. His presence, the Holy Spirit, will be with us every step of the way.

Sure we might be misunderstood, and at times mistreated. But if Jeremiah chapter 1 has taught us anything, it is that **if we want to be faithful to Christ, we are going to look foolish to the world.**

Let's pray.
