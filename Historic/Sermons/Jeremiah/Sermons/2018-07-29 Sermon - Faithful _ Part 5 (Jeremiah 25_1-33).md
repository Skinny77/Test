# Sermon: Faithful - Part 5: A Taste of Things to Come - Part 1 (Jeremiah 25:1-33)

## Introduction (229)

> If there is one thing that we all learn fairly quickly it is this: for better or worse, our actions have consequences.
>
> Think about it, it is obvious, isn't it! Actions have consequences.
>
> Some actions have positive consequences. For example, if you make all the payments on a hire purchase at the end of the plan you own the car.
>
> Some consequences are neutral - neither positive or negative.
>
> If I throw something in the air like this {_Thow Something in the Air_}, gravity will eventually bring it back down.
>
> That's neither good nor bad, it's just something that happens.
>
> Other actions have negative, even disastrous consequences.
>
> If you kill someone, you go to prison - despite what the Daily Mail might say.
>
> For better or worse, our Actions have consequences.

Something which Jeremiah is going to press home today, in chapter 25:1-33.

The roadmap for our time together this morning looks like this:

1.  Consequences for God's People (Jeremiah 25:1-14)
2.  Consequences for Everyone Everywhere (Jeremiah 25:15-33)
3.  Consequences for God's Son (Matthew 26:36-42)

> Now I know its... "another happy sermon on a happy chapter of Jeremiah!"

I'm not going to pretend that Jeremiah is an easy book, it isn't.

But hang in there, its worth it!.

## 1. Consequences for God's People (25:1-14) (1006)

Firstly, then, Consequences for God's People. Jeremiah 25:1-14.

> I wonder what comes to mind when you think of the discipline you experienced growing up?
>
> Would you say your parents were fair? Did the consequences always fit the crime
>
> or did you ever feel like they were overreacting? Did they have a favourite child or did they treat you all the same?
>
> My parents did the best job with the hand they were dealt - they weren't perfect, but then, what parent is?
>
> But I'll never forget that when my Dad started counting you did not want him to get past three!
>
> There were times when I really wanted to call his bluff, but I never had the bottle.
>
> My eldest sister though... that's a different story!
>
> I can remember several times when she'd call him out. He'd start counting and she'd just stare him down.

Jeremiah 25:1-2 begins by setting the scene. We're about halfway through Jeremiah's ministry now and everything is about to change for God's people.

It is the point when everything changes for the Book of Jeremiah too.

From here on out Jeremiah's message goes from "this is what will happen if you don't return to God" to "this is what _has_ happened because you would not return to God."

> The Lord's finished counting to three, but his people have decided to call him out. Now they're about to find the hard way that he was not bluffing.

It's 605BC, and by the time year is out, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon will have completed the first of four invasions.

Jeremiah's God-given warnings are about to come true.

Countless thousands will be sent into exile, countless more will die. And in the end, they will know, that God was not bluffing.

Their sinful actions have serious consequences.

I think at this point, we need to hit the pause button.

> For many of us we are so used to thinking about God's love, grace, mercy, and forgiveness when we come face-to-face with God's anger and wrath in passages like this, it can be a hard pill to swallow.
>
> But I think part of the battle in understanding it is knowing the right questions to ask.
>
> When hearing about God's judgement, we can be tempted to ask "Is God really like that?"
>
> But if God really is all those things - loving, gracious, merciful, forgiving, then a better question to ask is, "What on earth would make God do this?"

Jeremiah 25:3-7 help us answer that question.

What might surprise you is that first thing we learn about the reason behind God's judgement is that the people have tested his patience one too many times.

And he _has_ been incredibly patient.

Look at v3, Jeremiah tells that for twenty-three years he has faithfully spoken the warnings that God has given them. And he says "but you have not listened."

> Twenty-three years! Can you imagine what it must have been like for Jeremiah?
>
> God giving him the same message day in day out, and yet getting the same response from the people day-in-day-out!

But Jeremiah's ministry is just a drop in the ocean compared to God's long-suffering patience with his people.

Becuase it is not just Jeremiah they have ignored, it is all the prophets who've gone before him too.

The list is impressive:

-   Jonah
-   Amos
-   Hosea
-   Isaiah
-   Micah
-   Nahum
-   Joel
-   Zephaniah
-   and Habakkuk

Nine prophets spanning over 170 years all warning God's people "This is what will happen if you continue to follow the false God's of the nations and reject the Lord, the one true God."

Even when the Assyrian's destroyed the Northern Kingdom of Israel in 722BC, God's people in the south still didn't get the message.

Their rulers flip-flopped in their political relationships, as the hearts of the people flip-flopped between the Lord and foreign idols.

Yet the whole time God's prophets faithful warned God's people.

Both the carrot and the stick of their Holy Spirit inspired messages are summarised for us in v5-6.

First the carrot, the positive encouragement in v5: _"Turn now, each of you, from your evil ways and your evil practices, and you can stay in the land the LORD gave to you and your fathers forever and ever."_

And then the stick, the negative warning in v6: _"Do not follow other gods to serve and worship them; do not provoke me to anger with what your hands have made. Then I will not harm you."_

But as verse 7 reminds us, they did not listen to those who came before any more than they listen to Jeremiah.

> For almost 170 years God patiently warned and encouraged his people through the prophets he sent them. 170 years!
>
> I don't know about you, but when my kids are playing up, sometimes I struggle to keep my patience for 170 seconds!
>
> Suddenly God's actions are put in a whole new light, right?

For three generations his anger has been slowly building as he patiently waits for his wayward people to return to him.

But now God's done counting to three, and it's time for his people to learn that his actions have consequences.

There's both an irony and a fittedness to God's punishment.

Since they were so keen to serve a foreign king rather than be ruled by the Lord, and since they were so keen to follow foreign gods rather than worship the God of Israel.

The Lord Gives them what they want! Those who don't die in Nebuchadnezzar's invasions are carried off to live in the Babylonian empire, the home of the Babylonian kings and religion for seventy years.

The goal is that they learn from the mistakes of the past and return to the Lord and God that they had abandoned and neglected.

It isn't just a punishment, it is also discipline.

All discipline is painful for the child, even when it comes from a loving parent. And the same is true here as God lovingly disciplines his people.

Their actions have had dire consequences and God's slow-building anger and incredible patience have ensured that the punishment justly fits the crime.

But as verses 12-14 hint, Babylon's actions will have consequences too. As we'll see next.

## 2. Consequences for Everyone Everywhere (25:15-33) (1076)

Secondly, consequences for the nations. Jeremiah 25:15-33.

> As you can imagine, what with Abi doing an MA in Bioethics, we spend a lot of time in our house discussing medical cases.
>
> But one that has always stuck with me is the case of Harold Shipman.
>
> On 31st January 2000, Dr Harold Shipman was convicted of multiple murders.
>
> A family doctor by trade, Shipman, over a period of many years administered lethal doses of painkillers to elderly women and the falsified both death certificates and medical records to cover his tracks.
>
> Though he was convicted of 15 counts of a murder, an inquiry following his imprisonment linked him too well over 250 deaths spanning almost 30 years.
>
> In the closing remarks of the case, the judge, Mr Justice Forbes spoke directly to Shipman, saying,
>
> > "you should know that I have come to the firm conclusion that the crimes with which you now stand convicted are so heinous that in your case life must mean life.
> >
> > My recommendation will be that you should spend the remainder of your days in prison."

Sometimes a judge decides on a sentence which is **restorative**.

The purposes of the punishment are that justice is served as the person learns from their mistakes. The goal is that they re-enter society a better person.

Sometimes though, actions are so serious, or to use the words of Mr Justice Forbes, "wicked", that no opportunity for restoration is left.

The only way that justice can be met is through a sentence which is **punitive**.

Action intended only to punish; an action which removes the offender from society, forever, with no hope of restoration.

The Judge, Mr Justice Forbes decided that this was the only course of action left in the case of Harold Shipman.

He had taken away the freedom of others live and flourish, now he would suffer the same fate for the rest of his life.

The Lord's purpose in bringing the Babylonian's down on his own people was restorative.

The goal of the punishment was that they return from 70 years in captivity a more dedicated people.

A people who had learnt from the mistakes of those who came before them.

That is not the case in the second half of our chapter.

In verses 15-33, the Lord reveals himself not as the father and king of Israel, but Lord and Judge of all humanity.

Up until this point in the book, Jeremiah has mainly been dealing with messages for his own people.

But now the scope of his ministry increases as he becomes the true 'prophet to the nations' that the Lord called him to be in chapter 1:5.

The language is very visual but also quite shocking. Look at v15:

_This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, said to me: "Take from my hand this cup filled with the wine of my wrath and make all the nations to whom I send you drink it._

_When they drink it, they will stagger and go mad because of the sword I will send among them._

And again v27-28:

_Then tell them, ‘This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says:_

_Drink, get drunk and vomit, and fall to rise no more because of the sword I will send among you._

_But if they refuse to take the cup from your hand and drink, tell them, ‘This is what the LORD Almighty says: You must drink it!_

The words Jeremiah is to speak to the nations are not requests.

They are commands. "You will experience my justice", God says, "and you can't avoid it." This is not restorative justice but punitive justice.

There are no second chances for these nations, no opportunity to return to God wiser and more able to make their way in the world.

These people are to be removed from the face of the earth forever.

In many ways, the heart of the section is that God is putting on the nations what they have put on others.

> They're nations known for war, political corruption, exploitation of the vulnerable, child sacrifice, religious prostitution, societal immorality, and a whole host of what we might call 'human rights abuses'.

Even for Babylon, perhaps the worst of the bunch, there is no escaping the Kings justice.

> In 539BC exactly seventy years after Nebuchadnezzar's first invasion of Jerusalem. King Cyrus the Great of Persia invaded Babylon and brought the ageing empire to its knees.

That is simply historical fact!

And then in v29, we're given the reason for this punishment: if God's own people did not escape his justice. No other nation, no other person will either

In v17-25 the list of those involved is all-encompassing.

It begins with God's people in Judah. Only a small number would head into exile, graciously provided a second chance. The rest would be the epicentre of God's justice.

But like ripples on a pond spreading out from the point where the stone breaks the surface, God's justice is going to ripples out to the nations surrounding Judah.

Nine groups of nations beginning in Egypt in the south, moving around to the east, and then finally finishing with nations in the north with Babylon, cryptically referred to as the King of Sheschach at the end of v26.

But the ripples don't stop there. v30-32 pictures God as a roaring lion emerging from his den.

Here the final ripple of his justice sweeps across all people everywhere. Everyone will one day stand before the Lord and give an account. As the bone-chilling language of v33 points out.

> One day God's justice will be so all-encompassing that there will be no-one left to pick up the pieces.

Jeremiah uses a picture of total war, an invasion that results in an entire population lying dead in the streets, to communicate the seriousness and scope of that God's final expression of his justice.

A day, which, the storyline of the Bible makes clear, will involve you and me, and all the people who have ever lived.

In Acts 17:31 Paul tells the people of Athens that God

_"has set a day when he is going to judge the world in righteousness by the man he has appointed._

_He has provided proof of this to everyone by raising him {Jesus Christ} from the dead."_

Jesus death and resurrection is the proof that we will one day stand before him and face his justice.

But what if in God's plan, the man who proves that justice is coming for us, is also our only hope of escaping it?

## 3. Consequences for God's Son (Matthew 26:36-42)

Turn with me to Matthew 26:36-42. As we consider the consequences for God's Son.

-   Alexey Ananenko
-   Valery Bespalov
-   Boris Baranov

> You've probably never heard of them, but 30 years ago they diverted a crisis which could have resulted in deaths of millions of people.
>
> It was 1st May 1986, five days after the explosion of the Chernobyl nuclear reactor in modern day Ukraine.
>
> Soviet officials discovered to their horror that the reactor core was still in meltdown and slowly eating through the concrete barrier between the core and the 5 million gallon coolant tank.
>
> Should the 185 tons of radioactive molten metal be allowed to hit the water the plume of irradiate steam produced would kill millions.
>
> and leave most of Eastern Europe a radioactive wasteland for 500,000 years. Clearly, something had to be done.
>
> The plan was simple three engineers would dive into the coolant pool. Locate the emergency release values and drain the coolant tank before the core breached the concrete divider. Simple.
>
> Simple for everyone except Alexey Ananenko, Valery Bespalov, Boris Baranov. The three engineers.
>
> For them, it was a suicide mission. They would give there lives so that countless millions more could live.
>
> When they entered the coolant tank no one believed the three men would come out. Miraculously they did.
>
> In every way that matters, these men faced certain death and saved millions...

In Matthew 26:36-42, we meet another man consider a mission that would mean certain death.

> Only this time you know his name, his name is Jesus of Nazareth. But unlike the Chernobyl three, Jesus has been preparing for this moment his whole life.

Here we join Jesus contemplating the events the next 24 hours would bring. Matthew, one of those disciples, records the event for us. v36:

_Then Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane, and he told the disciples, "Sit here while I go over there and pray.”_

_Taking along Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to be sorrowful and troubled._

_He said to them, "I am deeply grieved to the point of death._

_Remain here and stay awake with me.” Going a little farther, he fell facedown and prayed, "My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me. Yet not as I will, but as you will.”_

In the garden of Gethsemane Jesus stands at the point of no return.

> He's like those divers standing on the edge of the coolant tank in Chernobyl. One more step and there'll be no turning back.

And so he does the only thing he can do at that moment, He prayers and asks for another way.

You see Jesus is afraid... Of a Cup.

> A cup? Who fears a cup?!

The cup that Jesus fears is the same cup that the nations are made to drink in Jeremiah 25:15 & 27.

It is the cup of God's wrath. This is what Jesus fears.

On the cross, Jesus would drink the cup filled with God's wrath against the sins of the nations. And despite his fears, this is what he chooses to do.

See v42? _"Again, a second time, he went away and prayed, "My Father, if this cannot pass unless I drink it, your will be done.”_

We've already seen that all people everywhere will one day face drinking the cup of God's wrath. One day everyone will be made to answer for there crimes.

But what about Jesus? He lived a perfect life; He has no crimes. Why does he have to experience God's wrath?

Afterall, Matthew 25:31-34 is clear that it will be none other than Jesus himself delivering the justice on that day.

> So why is Jesus, here in the garden, agreeing to face God's justice for us? For me? for you?
>
> The answer is breathtaking. He does out of love of the Father and love for us.
>
> Jesus who had lived a perfect life is willing and able to take on himself all of our sins and make them his own.
>
> And then at the cross experience the punishment that we deserve and then to die the death that should have been us.
>
> Why does he do it? He does it because he loves us.
>
> In three hours on the cross, Jesus experienced the wrath that I would have faced for all eternity in hell. And he did it because he loved me.

He did it so that through trusting in him I might be forgiven and escape the King's justice. Instead, from now on God sees me as if I have lived Jesus' life!

Jesus death on the cross is restorative. The goal is to restore sinners to God who loves them and made them for himself.

> Now that's love! That's mercy! That Jesus would get what we deserve so that we would get what Jesus deserves! That's incredible!

Now I no longer need to fear that final day where I stand before Jesus thrown and face him as Judge of all the nations.

> Because when the cup comes to me, the King Jesus will step down from his throne and say _"No, not him. He goes free because I have drunk the cup on his behalf."_

If you have turned from sin and sought forgiveness in Jesus that will be the same for you too.

> At the cross, Jesus loved you enough to take your share of God's justice, so that through trusting in him you might have a share in his perfect life.

And the New Testament tells us that Jesus return to life is the proof that all this is true.

> At the heart of the gospel is this: out of love, Jesus drank the cup of Jeremiah 25, so that you don't have to.

Our sinful actions have terrible consequences for our future. Yet Jesus actions have glorious consequences for those who turn from sin and trust in him.

# Actions Have Consequences (325)

> Let me give you one consequence to think about as we wrap up. we all struggle to have an accurate view of ourselves.
>
> And if we're not careful passages like these can only make that worse. Which means we end up looking on ourselves rather than looking up to Jesus.
>
> When that happens we either think, _"I'm a terrible person". Or we can think, "Nah, I'm not that bad really"._
>
> On one level, the cross presents us with our worse fear, we are as bad as these passages say we are.
>
> But on the other hand that is now irrelevant. That's right. Irrelevant!
>
> Because now there is someone who loves us and considers us of such value and importance to himself that he willingly gives his life for us so that we can escape God's justice.
>
> That kind of love changes how we view ourselves forever.
>
> When I think about that kind of love I find I am more willing to take hold of my own sinfulness and not let it affect how I view myself - either thinking I am better or worse than I really am.
>
> Because I know that even though I am not good enough. Jesus life-giving love has made me good enough.

And if you a Christian here today, that is true for you too. Because of his life-giving love, Jesus drank the cup to make you good enough... You! Yes, even you!

If that is not a reason to realign how you view yourself and worship Jesus today, well, then I don't know what is.

But this new way of viewing ourselves can only be ours if Jesus is a saviour. It is a consequence of turning from sin and trusting Jesus for forgiveness.

Otherwise, we could never be good enough and one day we will face God's justice.

Our actions have consequences. What action will you take today and what will be the consequences?

Let's pray.
