Dear {ChidsName},

I hope you are well and looking forward to the weekend.

I'm emailing you to invite you to a special workshop only for young people in Year 6 (like you!) which I'll be running straight after Sunday School on Sunday 20th May in the main church meeting area - the place with all the pews ;-).

One of the things we love as a church is having young people like yourselves read the bible during the Sunday service. This workshop is to give you a flavour for what that is like (if you haven't done it before) and to help you grow as young readers.

Our time together will be very relaxed. First, we'll talk a little bit about what makes a good reading. Then I'll read a passage of the bible and you get to tell me what you thought I did well and what you think I could improve. Final, you and the other Year Six-ers will each take a turn to read the same passage and we'll do the same. All being well, we'll be finished and ready to go home by 1pm.

I've attached a copy of the passage that we'll be working with on the day, Philippians 2:1-13. I've purposefully picked it because it is a tricky passage. Don't be nervous though, but I'm confident you and the others will be able to master it with a bit of practice. I've also include a few tips to help you with the reading.

If you could ask your parents to let me know whether or not you'd like to attend that would be great. That way I'll know who to expect when we all meet together.

Look forward to seeing on Sunday 20th May, straighth after Sunday School in the main church.

Don't be afraid to ask me any questions about the workshop or the reading. I'd love to hear from you.

God bless, Liam
