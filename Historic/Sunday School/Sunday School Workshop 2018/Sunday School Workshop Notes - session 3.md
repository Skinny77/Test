# Sunday School Workshop 2018 - Teaching Scripture; Changing Lives (Notes)

## Session 3 - Fostering a Culture of Change

In this last session we are going to look at some practical ways that we can create an environment inside the classroom that fosters change.
    1. Will examine some common errors to avoid,
    2. We'll look at setting an example of Change
    3. and setting boundaries for behaviour

### Avoid Errors

-   When talking about change it is easy to get the wrong end of the stick.
    -   And our approach as teachers comes from the wrong starting point
        -   Which results in us seeing our audience incorrectly
-   SO before we even thinking about fostering change
    -   Here are three errors of thinking to avoid.
        1.  'Jarheads'
            -   sees children as empty vessels just waiting for us to fill them up with knowledge
            -   this is incorrect because it does not appreciate that no is neutral to faith.
            -   But also they bring their own assumptions and values from home and culture.
            -   And as Mark 10:15 reminds us, the Jarhead approach fails to realise that Children have something to teach us about faith and obedience also.
        2.  'Pet Projects'
            -   The pet project is usually a particularly good child or a particularly bad children
                -   Either way they are treated differently to the other children
                    -   Perhaps they are always asked first for answer or never asked
                    -   Maybe they're let off the hook because they're good, or never let off the hook because they are particularly bad
            -   The pet project approach fails to realise that morality and godliness are not always the same
                -   An outwardly bad child may inwardly love the Lord Jesus but struggling to change
                -   Whilst an outwardly moral child may inwardly hate the Lord Jesus because they depend on their own righteousness
            -   Ultimately, the pet project approach is either positive or negative favouritism.
                -   Which James 2:1 warns us against.
        3.  'Mr Fix it'
            -   the 'Mr Fix It' approach essentially only sees children as problems to be resolved
                -   Often this comes with strong sweeping judgements about the child or their parents
                -   and comes out in statements like 'They just need to X'
                -   Or 'parents just need to Y'
            -   The problem with the 'Mr. Fix it' approach is that children are people
                -   and people are more than the sum of their issues.
            -   Often 'the just need to do' method looks for change in behaviour modification and not in gospel-tranformation.
                -   Simply it promotes works righteousness
-   So three approaches to children and change to avoiud
    -   Jarheads - or under estimateing children
    -   Pet projects - or favouritism (either positive or negative)
    -   And 'Mr fix it' - Behaviour modification
-   So if if that how not to foster change in a classroom, how do we go about fostering it?

### Settting an example

-   The road to fostering change in the lives of children begins long before the first child walks into to church on a Sunday morning.
    -   because change starts here, with us.
        -   We have to set an example to the children worth imitating.
            -   Let me explain what i mean.
-   As Sunday School teachers you inhabit several roles. {Draw}
    -   teacher - you teach them scripture, help them apply the gospel
    -   Pastor - caring for their spiritual needs, praying for them, seeking their good
-   but there is one more role that you inhabit.
    -   And that is the role of **exmaple**
        -   For children in Nurersy - year 6 you are one of the single biggest influences in shaping their understanding of what godly christian maturity looks like.
            -   So if we are not pursuing change, or gospl transformation, in our own lives, like the glory of God depends on it
                -   how are we to expect them to want to puruse it either?
            -   If we are not displaying the fruit of the spirit in our own lives
                -   Why would they desire them in their own?
        -   Ultimately If we deny with our actions what we teach in our lessons
            -   they won't believe that we have their spiritual wellbeing at heart
            -   And they won't listen to anything teach them
        -   Few things harden a persons heart to the gospel like ministry hypocrisy.

#### Activity: Fruit of the SPirit

-   So what does it look like to set an example of godliness to those young people?
    -   There is a bunch of passage we could go to
        -   But today we are going to look at one verse: Gal 5:22 fruit of the spirit
        -   paul writes "the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control."
-   Remember the fruit of the Spirit are not like a bunch of Bananas were we might have love and joy but not paitence.

    -   all 9 of them make up the one fruit

        -   Like segments in an orange they'll all be present in a mature disciple of Jesus in one degree or another.
        -   If one or more is missing entirely, something is not right.

    -   Here is what I'd like you to do.
        -   In you handout on page 21 you'll see a table
            -   In the first column you'll see one of the fruit of the spirit eg. love
            -   and in the second write as many ways that love might express itself in your role as a Sunday School teacher (eg. helping children understand and believe the gospel)
            -   When you run out of ideas, move on to the next one.
            -   IF youget through all seven then use column 3 to do write examples of what the fruit might look like in a child's life.
        -   Table 1 can you start at the with love and work forward
        -   Table 2 can you please start with self-control and work back.
            -   Work together as a table if you'd like
            -   ten minutes and then we'll feedback.
        -   **Feedback on flip chart**

### Setting the Boundaries

-   But clearly, fostering an environment of change is more than showing people what aim for
    -   It is also helping them know what to avoid
        -   And that means setting appropriate boundaries within the classroom Setting
            -   Now, obviously we cannot inforce how a child feels towards us or the Lord in their heart
            -   And we cannot enforce what they are to believe.
                -   This is another reason why are ultimately dependant on the Holy Spirit to bring about real change in a chidl's life
-   However, we can help a child see when they're behaviour is unacceptable

    -   and, where appropriate, help them track that back to a heart or head issue that needs to change
        -   That's not to say that everytime a child interrupts you spend twenty minutes of the lesson trying to diagnose their heart sin.
            -   Part of it is knowing what issues to tackle and which to let go.
    -   For example, when a child hits another you might say
        -   "Jesus used his strength to help people and not to hurt them, and if we are going to love people like he does, then we need to use our strength to help people and not hurt them."
    -   Or when someone says something mean to someone else and upset them,
        -   We might say "When God speaks in the bible it is always true, and alway for our good. Loving God and loving our neighbour means only speaking to others what is good for them and what what is true about them."
    -   In both of those examples, I've identified three things:
        -   The boundary that has been crossed (Hitting, mean langauge)
        -   The biblical reason why it is a sin (Not loving God; not loving neighbour)
        -   And want needs to change (stop hurting, start helping / speak the truth in love)
    -   Sometimes it might be enough to simplyt say 'Jimmy please stop talking'
    -   Other times like in the case of hitting or mean words you might need you to stop the lesson and address the issue directly,
    -   sometimes it might be better to have a quite word outside or at the end of the lesson
    -   If that fails, don't be afraid to speak to the parents.
        -   At ACC we follow the biblical model of family where dad is the servant leader of the home.
            -   So if you have an issue with a chlid's behaviour that, having tried everything, still cannot be resolved in the classroom go and speak to dad about it.
                -   Or mum if Dad is not around
                -   If you can speak to both at the same time even better!
        -   In extreme cases, if all that fails, come and find me and will consider what to do next.

-   However you address behaviour, here are seven helpful principles to consider:

    1.  **Be Consistent**
        -   Broad consistenancy as a team is good, but personal consistency is essentially. Children will learn that some teacher are stricter than others. Thats fine. But as much as it depends on you be consistent in how you address behaviour.
    2.  **Be age-appropriate**
        -   How you tackle the behaviour of a child whose just come up form creche will look different to a child year 2. In the same way, how you tackle behaviour whose coming to adventures for the first time, will be different to a year 6 whose been attending for years.
    3.  **Be fair and just**
        -   the punishment must always fit the crime and not how good or bad you think the child is. Don't make excuses for good kids, don't make examples of bad kids. 1 Corinthians 13:5 reminds us that "love keeps no record of wrongs" so address the behaviour of a child in that moment, not based on their past performance. discipline should always be done out of love and a desire to seek a child's best interests. Never simply to punish.
    4.  **Be child-specific**
        -   Senstive child or arrogant child, one whose discipline rarely or harshly, boy, girl. Each child is unique and will respond to the same approach differently. Get to know your children and what methods work or don't work. If you are struggling try talking to the parents and ask what works at home. Then try that.
    5.  **Be Forward Looking**
        -   Hebrews 12:11 says "No discipline seems pleasant at the time, but painful. Later on, however, it produces a harvest of righteousness and peace for those who have been trained by it." We address poor behaviour out of a desire for the child to come to repentance and grow in godliness. we do this recognising that we may never see that in our time as their teacher, but trust God for their future
    6.  **Be Relational**
        -   Get to know your children inside and outside of the classroom. Find out what they like and enjoy, take time to talk to them over coffee or say 'hello' on a Sunday morning. If they know that you care tabout them, they are more likely to listen when you address their behaviour. Or as one ministry mentor drilled into me "no one cares how much your know, until they know how much you care."
    7.  **Be Dependant**
        -   Setting the boundaries and enforcing them not only helps children see that there _are_ boundaries of appropriate behaviour, is also helps them to see that God is deeply concerned with the holiness of his people.
        -   Holiness of heart, holiness of head, and holiness of hands. he wants people who think holy thoughts, to have a holy character, and live holy lives. We can show that to them, we teach to them, we can encraouge it in them. Only the Holy Spirit can create it in them. Seeking the Spirit to work in a child's life, must be our first and final stop in addressing behaviour.

-   So there is seven principles for address behaviour in the the classroom.

#### Activity: Case Studies on Addressing Behaviour

-   In this last activity I'd like you to start putting some these principles into practice

    -   Take a look at the list of behavioural examples in the booklet
        -   How will you address the issue? When and where? If you are going to say something to them what will you say?
    -   How will you stick to the seven principles we looked at a moment ago?
    -   Could the situation have been avoided by earlier intervention? If so, how?
    -   What will you do now?
    -   Where appropriate how will you help the child understand
        -   The boundary that has been crossed (Hitting, mean langauge)
        -   The biblical reason why it is wrong (Not loving God; not loving neighbour)
        -   And want needs to change (stop hurting, start helping / speak the truth in love)
    -   You may even offer to pray with them about it?

-   table 1 can you start at the bottom and work up, table 2 can you start at the top and work down.

**Feedback**

End with a thank you.

Pray for them!
