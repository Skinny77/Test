## Session 1: The Destination of Transfomation (10:00 - 10:30)

When I was in my early teens I had a really close friend who lived around the corner from my Dad's house. We were so close that in the school holidays I think I spent more time at his house than I did at my own.

I was so close with his family that I even used to go on holiday with them to Devon. Now, there is something important that you need to know about early teenage 'me', and it is going to shock you, but I promise you it is true.

{Deep-breath} I was a bit of a geek. No, I was a massive geek. I know, I know, it is hard to believe but it is true. Particularly, I was obessed with Dinosaurs. There was nothing that fifteen year old me and my fossil collection didn't know about dinosaurs.

One year it so happened that my holiday with my friend and his family co-incided with my birthday and so my friends parents kindly arranged a boat trip along only the Jurassic Coast. Well to say I was excited was an understatement.

We drove for hours, circled for parking, found our seats on the boat, and set sail... Suffice to say it was not what I expected... What felt like a lifetime sailing past some crumbly old rocks with a nasle old mail rambling into a microphone. Boy was I dissapointed...

The description at the hotel had drawn me in, but the destination failed to deliver. I tried to be interested, but by the tour guide had lost me completely.

As bible teachers, every lesson, every children's talk, invites children to come with us on a journey, to follow us to a destination. And if we are not careful we can inadvertently take children to a destination that we might think will be perfect for them, which in reality could leave them underwhelmed with Christianity and Jesus in particular. Or worse, with a false impression of that the Christian life is all about.

IN his book 'Messages that Move' author Tim Hawkins says that there is only one destination worthy of those we are teaching. He says...

> If you’re going to take your listeners to a destination, you need to make sure that the destination is worth going to! And can I suggest right now that there is only one destination worth taking people to? It’s a destination called “Change-ville”.
>
> It is the destination of gospel transformation... I want to suggest to you that if your destination does not focus on life change, then the journey was not worth the effort...
>
> For your destination to be worthwhile and meaningful for your audience, something in them has to change. Something in their lives needs to be challenged to be different.

This morning is all about change. It is all about equipping each other to help the children we teach to reach the "destination of transformation."

In this first session we are thinking about gopel-transformation, about change, from Four directions.

A.  What is change?
B.  why does it matter?
C.  What does and doesn't motivates change?
D.  Where does change come from?

-   This will set the background.

### a. What is Change??

-   What is change?
    -   It is the difference that is the Holy Spirit produces in a Child because they have engaged with God's word. {Repeat}
        -   In other words, when they leave they are no longer the same as they were when they came in.
    -   That difference is the change we are after
        -   Or what Hawkins calls 'Gospel transformation'
-   That change/difference occures in three places
    -   Head
    -   Hands
    -   Heart

{Draw picture}
{Explain}

-   Head
    -   Belief - what we conclude is true
    -   Knowledge - information based on evidence
    -   Understanding - why our belief and knowledge matters
        -   Head change involves helping children get to grips with scripture, doctrine, etc.
-   Heart
    -   Character: growing in maturity, and godliness
    -   Desires: wanting to be the person that God wants them to be; growing love for the Lord Jesus
    -   Trust: not simplying believing truths, and doing the right thing, but trusting that God has their best at Heart
        -   Heart change focus on what they want and what they want to be like
-   Hands
    -   Actions: Behaviour, lifestyle, etc.
    -   Will: Chocies that they make
    -   gifts: using talents and abilities to lovingly serve God and neighbour
        -   Hands change focus on what they do and how they live


-   this is the change we want to see in Children, because it is the change we want to see in all Christians, and even in ourselves.

Very quickly, on your page rank these in order of which gets "most to least" focus in your sunday school teaching. 1= biggest focus, 3 = least focus.

Granted some passage naturally lead us to one or two of the three. But Ideally, we are aiming for balance in all situations.

## Why does change matter?

Two reasons:

-   Change matters because God requires it
-   because God has planned it into all aspects of the Christian life

    -   Becoming a Christian = Change
        -   Ephesians 2:4-5 say _"But because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, made us alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions...."_
            -   Whats the change?
                -   Spiritual dead -> spiritually alive (Big change!)
            -   This is the doctrine of regeneration
    -   The Future of a Christian = Change
        -   John writes in 1 John 3:2 _"Dear friends, now we are children of God, and what we will be has not yet been made known. But we know that when Christ appears, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is."_
            -   What change will happen at Jesus return?
                -   We'll be perfect like he is perfect
            -   THis is the doctrine of glorification
    -   Being a Christian Now = Change
        -   John adds in v3,
            -   _"All who have this hope in him purify themselves, just as he is pure"_
                -   What are the changes as we consider Jesus return?
                    -   We hope in him for the future, we pursue holiness in the meantime
                -   This is the doctrine of progressive sanctificaiton

-   Change is one of the primary ways that God brings himself glory in the life of the Christian and the salvation of the non-Christian.
    -   Change matters because God's glory matters!

### C. What motivates change?

-   When we think about motivating change what do we mean?

    -   giving children a reason to pursue it, to want it.
        -   ANALOGY: buying a car. Not just why the car is good, but why it is good for you.
        -   SIMIARLY: as teachers, When reading the scripture passage as you prepare, ask:
        -   Based on this passage...
            -   Why do I need to change?
            -   Why do they need to change?
        -   we explain where we need to our audeince to change but why they need to change
        -   And we'll see later, we need to set an example of change too.

-   it would take to long to cover every motive for change.
    -   Instead, here are three common errors
    -   then three biblical motives.
-   Three misteps

    1.  **The Cheerleader appracoh**
        -   Tries to bring about change by positivity and inner-strenth
        -   Rarely mentions sin or its consequence
        -   Not totally bad, we want children to uses there God-given abilities to to the full...
        -   but The cheerleader motive  never creates lasting change last because it is built on the child looking inside for strength not outward to God.
        -   Ultimately the cheerleader approach teaches children to trust themselves and their abilites and not the Holy Spirit and his power for real change
    2.  **The Parent Appraoch**
        -   bring change through morality -> "you should tell the truth becuase its the right thing to do"
        -   OR "Don't lie, lying is wrong!"
        -   This is an issue because we live in an age and place were morality is subjective.
        -   but more than that in scripture goodness and badness are always tied to God's character
        -   But ultimately, the parent approach Tries make bad children good and good children better without appeal to the gospel.
    3.  **The 'Oxfam' approach**
        -   Where we try to guilt them into action.
        -   Like the cheerleader is brings about change in the short-term but it never lasts
        -   And like the oxfam adverts, we have to keep ramping it up each time to be effective
        -   Comes across self-righteous
        -   eventually there comes a point where they stop listing because they've stopped caring.

-   So that's some traps to avoid. Because each misunderstands how biblical change is brought about.

here are some examples of biblical motives for change
1.  **Conviction of sin.**
    \-   Like a patient diagnosed with a sickness seeks a doctor
    \-   People convicted of sin pursue a savior
    \-   Acts 2:36-37, Peter says "Therefore let all Israel be assured of this: God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ. When the people heard this, they were cut to the heart and said to Peter and the other apostles, “Brothers, what shall we do?”""
        \-   Convicted of sin, they realised they needed to change.
    \-   Conviction of sin is different to the oxfam approach because it present our sinfulness as the problem and simply our actions
    \- And so Jesus's death and resurrect is the lasting solution to that brings about change
        \-   Not about making people feel bad, but realise that they are bad
        \- Not simply doing more, but trust in what Jesus has done
2.  **the Grace of God**
    \-   James 4:2 says "But he gives us more grace, that is why scripture says: God opposes the proud, but gives grace to the humble.
        \-   Knowing that there is an all powerful God is willing and able to help us if we are willing to ask him is a powerful motive to change
        \- MOre than that it calls us to look out of ourselves for a solution
        \- Not inward to our own strength
3.  **thankfulness**
    \-   Summed up best by Paul's word in Romans 12:1-2

> Therefore, I urge you, brothers and sisters, in view of God’s mercy, to offer your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God—this is your true and proper worship. Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God’s will is—his good, pleasing and perfect will.

    - When we understand all that god has done for us, gratitude motivates us to give alll that have to him and his glory.
    - Thankfulness for Jesus dying and rising again to forgive our sins and make us right with God is a massive motive for change.
        - because it is a motive that is biblical, gospel-focused, and positive.

-   There we are three motives to change... conviction of sin, the grace of God, and thankfulness.
-   biblical motives that create biblical results

### D. Where does change come from?

Lastly, where does change come from?

-   what do you think? What brings about change in a childs life? Throw out some answers to me {ThreeMins}

**Feedback on to flipchart**

-   when you think about where change comes from
    -   think S.I.S {Draw}
        -   Source
        -   Instrument
        -   Subject
-   What might the source of change be? Where does all change come from ultimately?
    -   God the Holy Spirit
-   What might the subject of change be then?
    -   A person (child, adult, christian, non-christian)
-   if the source of change is the Holy Spirit, and the subject of change is a person (child in our case)
    -   What might the instrameant of change be?
        -   All the things we've listed here.

### Sunday School Teacher as Instruments of Change

-   Particularly, in our case this morning we are thinking about two instruments
    1.  Your Sunday School lesson
    2.  You the Sunday School teacher
-   This is
    1.  Humbling
        -   we're involved in his work of changing lives
        -   He uses us inspire of and despite our weakness and failings, even though he doesn't need to
    2.  Encouraging
        -   If he is the one who brings change, our responsibility is only over what we can do something about (our lives and our lessons) the rest is up to him.
-   you and your lesson are two powerful instruments that the Holy Spirit can use to bring gospel transformation, genuine life change to the young people on a sunday
-   Which is what we are going to go on to look at over the rest of this morning.
