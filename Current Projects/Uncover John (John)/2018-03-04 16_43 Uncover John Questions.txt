# Study A: A Sign of What's Coming

### Introduction
_In his book **The Last Word**, author Thomas Nagal writes, 'I want atheism to be true, and I am made uneasy by the fact that some of the most intelligent and well informed people I know are religious believers. It isn't just that I don't believe in God, and naturally, hoppe that I'm right in my belief. It is that I hope there is no God. I don't want there to be a God, I don't that the universe to be like that.'_

**Why might someone 'hope there is no God'?**

**1/. What reason does John give for writing his biography of Jesus?**

**2/. John makes the identity of Jesus a major theme of his book. Who do you think might have been? How did you come to this conclusion?**

_In ancient Jewish thought the, the Christ or Messiah was a promised leader of the Jewish nation, who defeat the nation's enemies and lead the people an era of peace and properity._

#### Historical Context
> The first public encounter that John presents us with with is Jesus at a wedding with friends and family. Weddings in the first-century even more significant and lavish affairs than they are today. Marriage meant more than the joining of two individuals. A wedding markde the bride and groom's entrance into their community as adults. The celebrations usually lasted for at least a week. It was the responsibility of the groom to provide all the was necessary for such a hughely important social occasion.

**Read John 2:1-11**

**3/. The wedding has run out of wine. How might the bride and groom feel if there was no more wine at the wedding feast, especially in a shame/honour culture?**

**4/. If the wine was finished, what would the wedding crowd conclude about the groom in particular? What might the birde's family think about their new son-in-law?**

_In the Hebrew Bible, wine represented joy, so its absence at a wedding would be disastrous. Jesus' reply to his mother isn't as stark as it first looks, but it is quite puzzling, especially wehen he says, 'My hour has not yet come' in verse 4. Jesus seems to be a man who knows his destiny and sees his whole life as heading towards a particular moment._

**5/. Although Jesus is reluctant to step into the limelight at this point, why do you he does something quite miraculous to help the couple?**

**6/. Each of the six stone water jars would contain 80-120 Litres (~170-250 pints), the equivalent of 700-1,000 bottles, or 4,200-6,000 glasses of wine. Describe the master of the banquet's impression of the wine? How will this wine change the party?**

_NB: Wine was always cut with water in the Jewish world at a ratio of 1 parts wine to 3 parts water, sometimes more diluted that that._

**7/. What does the mater of the banquet conclude about the groom? Does the groom deserve the credit? How would the bride and groom feel about what Jesus has done for them?**

**8/. The water jars contained water for ceremonial washing. Before each meal Jews would wash, as a symbol of washing away their sins before receiving what God had given them. Thus the water in the jars was a continual reminder of their guilt and need for cleansing. Given this background, what might be the significance of Jesus turning this water into the most beautiful wine?**

_Jesus quietly rescued a wedding and saved a desperate couple from disgrace. But his disciples (or followers) saw the that his actions pointed to something far more significant about him. They would be familiar with an ancient Hebrew texts (the Old Testament) such as the following from the prophet Isaiah (c. 700BC):_ 

> 6 On this mountaing the Lord Almighty will prepare a feasth of rich food for all peoples, a banquet of aged wine— the best of meats and the finest of wines. 7 On this mountain he will destroy the shroud that enfolds all peoples, the sheet that covers all nations; 8	he will swallow up death forever. The Sovereign Lord will wipe away the tears from all faces; he will remove his people’s disgrace from all the earth. The Lord has spoken.
