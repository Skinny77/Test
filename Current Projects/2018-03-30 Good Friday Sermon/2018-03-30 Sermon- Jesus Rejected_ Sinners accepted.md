## Introduction

<!-- TODO Change to phobias introduction -->

<!-- When it comes to human relationships we're all different aren't we? Sure, their are some ways we can slice and dice things: What we look for in a friend or a spouse; whether we are fundamentally an introvert or an extrovert or somewhere in between; cat person or dog person. But even then we'd be different in the make up of the preferences, and their priorities.

There is though, one thing that we all share. One fundamental characteristic of human relationships that unintes us all. We all want to be accepted; we all fear being rejected. -->

Think about it. It is universal isn't it? We all wanted be accepted, we all like being liked. We all desire a person or a place where we feel that we can be ourselvs, somewhere we can drop our barriers without fear of being pushed away, shamed, or unfairly judged. Whether a friend or friendship group, a parent, or a spouse, when we've found it, if we are lucky enough to discover it, we treasure it.

Yet sometimes something holds us back in our quest for acceptance doesn't it? A dark concern, a haunting worry. I'm talking about the universal fear of rejection. We've all felt it, haven't we. It's what stopped us talking to person we fancied in school. It is the same thing that prevented us apply for that job really wanted, or the painful feeling we expirenced when we did get it. It is the hurt travels with redundancy letters. The ache of a parent we've never known, and hot fire cheating spouse.

But what if the fear and longing point towards a deep, more basic longing a fear that exists within all of us. What if under it all it reveals the knowledge that we know there is a great something behind the universe, maybe even a creator God, maybe even a Father God who desires to know us and be known by us. One whose acceptance or rejection of us could even shape our eternity and redefine our lives!

This evening, we explore the final moments of Jesus life; the life of man who knew acceptance and rejection like no other. And as we do, we are going to discover that **if we want be accepted by God, we need to trust in the one rejected by God** {Repeat}

To help us see why that is, we are going to use Matthew 27 to answer to simple questions:

1.  Why are our lives unacceptable to God?
2.  Why did Jesus have to be rejected by God?

So have your bible's open at Matthew 27, page 998 in red bibles.
