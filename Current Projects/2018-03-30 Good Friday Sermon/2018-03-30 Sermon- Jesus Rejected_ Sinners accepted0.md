## Introduction

<!-- TODO Change to phobias introduction -->

<!-- When it comes to human relationships we're all different aren't we? Sure, their are some ways we can slice and dice things: What we look for in a friend or a spouse; whether we are fundamentally an introvert or an extrovert or somewhere in between; cat person or dog person. But even then we'd be different in the make up of the preferences, and their priorities.

There is though, one thing that we all share. One fundamental characteristic of human relationships that unintes us all. We all want to be accepted; we all fear being rejected. -->

Think about it. It is universal isn't it? We all wanted be accepted, we all like being liked. We all desire a person or a place where we feel that we can be ourselvs, somewhere we can drop our barriers without fear of being pushed away, shamed, or unfairly judged. Whether a friend or friendship group, a parent, or a spouse, when we've found it, if we are lucky enough to discover it, we treasure it.

Yet sometimes something holds us back in our quest for acceptance doesn't it? A dark concern, a haunting worry. I'm talking about the universal fear of rejection. We've all felt it, haven't we. It's what stopped us talking to person we fancied in school. It is the same thing that prevented us apply for that job really wanted, or the painful feeling we expirenced when we did get it. It is the hurt travels with redundancy letters. The ache of a parent we've never known, and hot fire left by a cheating spouse.

But what if the fear and longing point towards a deep, more basic longing a fear that exists within all of us. What if under it all it reveals the knowledge that we know there is a great something behind the universe, maybe even a creator God, maybe even a Father God who desires to know us and be known by us. One whose acceptance or rejection of us could even shape our eternity and redefine our lives!

This evening, we explore the final moments of Jesus life; the life of man who knew acceptance and rejection like no other. And as we do, we are going to discover that **if we want be accepted by God, we need to trust in the one rejected by God** {Repeat}

To help us see why that is, we are going to zoom in on a two sections of Matthew 27. And as we do, we'll answer these questions:

1.  Why are our lives unacceptable to God? (Matthew 27:11-26)
2.  Why did Jesus have to be rejected by God? (Matthew 27:45-51)

So have your bible's open at Matthew 27, page 998 in red bibles.

## Why are our lives unacceptable to God?

So let's start with our first question, why are our lives unacceptable to God?

Film and fiction are filled with stories of painful rejection aren't they? Think about it for a moment: There's Edmund in the Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe; Gollum in the Lord of the Rings, Londo Calrisian in The Empire Strikes Back, Lots-o-Hugging Bear in Toy Story 3. Break ups, backstabs, betrayals they're everywhere in popular culture.

Anyone familiar with Jesus life will know that by the time he stands before Pilate, Jesus too has had his fair share of shocking betrayal and painful rejection. Only a chapter earlier, Judas, one of Jesus disciples had betrayed him and lead the religious authorities to arrest him. Then hours later, Peter rejected Jesus publicly, denying three times that he even knew the man that Peter had once promised to die for, rather than betray.

But before the events of chapter 27 are over, Jesus will experience rejection two more times. One publicly infront of crowd; the second privately on the cross. To understand the significance of the first, we need to understand some of the players in this tragedy. Matthew introduces us to a chast of character in verses 11-26.

The first group of players in this tragedy are the chief priests. Petty and jealous we know from chapter 26:57-66 that after a shame trial they eventually sentence Jesus to death on trumpt up charges of blasphamy. We later learn in Matthew 27:18 that they it is envy of Jesus that is ultimately driving their desire to see him killed. But even their ability to that is a shame. Since the Roman takeover in 63 BC the Jewish ruling council no longer had the right to sentence people to death without the Roman Governor signing off on it. So in v11 they bring Jesus to Pilate, and hope to use the governor as a tool to their own ends.

Pilate is next to appear on stage. Verses 11-26 make us realise that Pilate was not a man interested in truth or justice; by offering the crowd a the choice between Jesus and Barabbas, it makes only him look like a kind and gracious governoer. Better if the crowd choose Jesus Pilate also has the chance to score one up on the Jewish religious leaders by publicly embarrassing them.

Pilate was playing politics with an innocent mans life. Jesus was a piece to be played, a chip to be gambled. So Pilate places his bet, he rolls the dice.... and losses. Even after being warned by his wife... a lesson for husbands everywhere.

By v24, Pilate realises that his plan is going knowhere, washes his hands in front of them, a petty and sulky attempt to spare himself any guilt for his failed political manouverings.

The crowd, who come next in the cast list. Last Sunday, John walked us through Matthew 21, where in the opening verses the crowds of pilgrims descending on Jeruslam shouting and sining and waving palm banches as he donkey comes past. Whenever I read that passage I have expect Matthew to tell us the crowd ask Jesus to sign their copies of the Torah or something.

Now five days later, that same crowd are gathered outside the palace. Only this time that same crowd mentality is pointed towards Jesus with hate and loathing. The palm brances are gone, the only thing their waving in the air now are angry fists. Certainly, we're told in v20 the crowds choice was greatly influenced by the chief priests stitting them into a frenzy.

Yet, in v24-25, when Pilate shows his contempt for their decision the crowd are more than happy to take responsibility not only for Barabbas' realise - a man described in v16 as a notorious criminal, and in Mark 15:6 as a insurrectionist and murderer. But also for the death of Jesus, a man innocent of any crime and the victim of history's worst miscarriage of justice. The verses that follow describe Jesus being sentenced and handed over to the Roman Soilders to flogged, mocked, beaten, and spat upon.

So far in this section, Matthew has described us to three groups of the people: The chief priests, Pontious Pilate, and the gathered crowd. But what do any of them have to do with our first questions? How did this characters help us understand 'Why our lives are unacceptable to God?'

You see the each of the four gospel writers - Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, each go to great lengths to describe these events in some detail. Why is that? Certainly, they are presenting the evidence for the innocence of Jesus, that he was unfairly tried, wrongly condemned, and unlawfully killed. But what is something more is going on here?

The events from Jesus arrest in the Garden of Gethsemaneup until the his sentencing and crucifixion provide a shocking window into how the fallen humanity naturally respond to God. Remember, at the centre all of this scheming, deceving, rejecting, betraying, political manuvouring, and mocking is not a nice bloke who did some nice things for people in bottom runs of society. This is happening to the creator of the universe, the Lord of Heaven and Earth, standing in the midst of all this.

The truth is that our lives are unacceptable to God because in our hearts we are by nature no different to Judas, Peter, the religious leaders, pilate, the crowd, or the roman solders.
