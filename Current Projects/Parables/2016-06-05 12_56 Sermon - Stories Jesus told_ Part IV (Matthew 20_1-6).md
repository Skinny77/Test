## 0. Introduction

Recently I hit a parenting milestone. A rite of passage. The momeant that every parent knows is coming, but they hope, against all odds will never happen. I remember it well. It was a Thursday morning and I was making breakfast whilst Jonah sat at the table eating his breakfast cearel. As the smell of fresh coffee filled the kitchen, Jonah turned in his seat and asked, "Daddy?"

"Yes, Jonah" I replied.

"Can I have something else?"

"Have you finished your cereal?" I inquired, knowing full well the answer to my own question.

"No..." He groaned

"Well you know the rules Jonah. Once you've finished what you've already got, then you can have something else." I explained. This was a well rehearsed breakfast patter that Jonah and I shared most morning. We knew the retuine and we knew our lines, or so I thought.

"But... but..." Usually, at this point, Jonah would say. "Fine..." Turn around and continue eating. Only today, something changed he looked straight at me and said "But that's not fair!"

And there it was. Four words and our family would never been the same again. Now whenever things looked they were not going his way, Jonah could appeal to some external standard of justice. One which would always present him as the disadvantaged victem of an oppressive, totalitarian dichtorship called 'mum and dad.' Four words that could frustrate even the simplest request.

But in all seriousness, I think that in many ways we never grow out of that four year old view of fairness. Whether it's NHS wait times, queues at the post office, tax payments, missed job opportunities, or school placements. We are strange creatures who on the one hand can have an incredible developed sense of right and wrong, even when our moral compass is way off north. And still be cable of sniffing out imaginary injustices, even ones that concern half eaten bowls of rice crispies.

I mean think about it, when someone acts against us in a way that we deem unexceptable, our inner barrister brings the fall weight of heaven and earth down in judgement upon them. "How dare they unfriend me on facebook?! Who do they think they are?" And yet when we fail to live up to our own moral standards, something strange happens. Now an internal defence lawyer is hard at work devising legal loop holes that allow us to esacpe any guilt or blame scott free. "Well if you hadn't... I would never have..."

Truth is that whether four or ninety-four our basic undestanding of fairness, at least when it comes to ourselves, is often seriously out of whack! That's true in how we relate to others, but most especially in how we relate to God. Or maybe, how we expect him to relate to us.

In this mornings story that Jesus told, he is going to use a tale about fair pay to flip our undestanding of fairness on its head. And as he does that we are going to see something surprising. We're going to see that "It is God's outrageous favour which leads us to love our neighbour." {Repeat}

To help explain this parable, we are going to walk through the scenes one by one:

1.  The Excentric Employer (20:1-7)
2.  Checking the Paycheque (20:8-10)
3.  In the Boss' Office (20:11-16)

{Repeat}

That's where we're heading this morning. Now, there is only one more question to ask: Are you still comfortably? Then let's begin.
