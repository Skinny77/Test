## 0. Introduction

Recently I hit a parenting milestone. A rite of passage. The momeant that every parent knows is coming, but they hope, against all odds will never happen. I remember it well. It was a Thursday morning and I was making breakfast whilst Jonah sat at the table eating his breakfast cearel. As the smell of fresh coffee filled the kitchen, Jonah turned in his seat and asked, "Daddy?"

"Yes, Jonah" I replied.

"Can I have something else?"

"Have you finished your cereal?" I inquired, knowing full well the answer to my own question.

"No..." He groaned

"Well you know the rules Jonah. Once you've finished what you've already got, then you can have something else." I explained. This was a well rehearsed breakfast patter that Jonah and I shared most morning. We knew the retuine and we knew our lines, or so I thought.

"But... but..." Usually, at this point, Jonah would say. "Fine..." Turn around and continue eating. Only today, something changed he looked straight at me and said "But that's not fair!"

And there it was. from now on whenever things looked they were not going his way, Jonah could appeal to some external standard of justice. One which would always present him as the disadvantaged victem of an oppressive, totalitarian regime called 'mum and dad.'

But in all seriousness, Jonah is a great kid and weare very thankful for him. And whilst I used that story with his permission, it does illustrate an important observation about our lives.  In many ways we never grow out of that four year old view of fairness.

I mean think about it, when someone acts against us in a way that we deem unexceptable, our inner barrister brings the fall weight of heaven and earth down in judgement upon them. "How dare they unfriend me on facebook?! Who do they think they are?" And yet when we fail to live up to our own moral standards, something strange happens. Now an internal defence lawyer is hard at work devising legal loop holes that allow us to esacpe any guilt or blame scott free. "Well if you hadn't... I would never have..."

Truth is that whether four or ninety-four our basic undestanding of fairness, at least when it comes to ourselves, is often seriously out of whack! That's true in how we relate to others, but most especially in how we relate to God. Or maybe, how we expect him to relate to us.

In this mornings story that Jesus told, he is going to use a tale about fair pay to flip our undestanding of fairness on its head. And as he does that we are going to see something surprising. We're going to see that "It is God's outrageous favour which leads us to love our neighbour." {Slide} {Repeat}

To help explain this parable, we are going to walk through the scenes one by one: {Slide}

1.  The eccentric Employer (20:1-7)
2.  Checking the Paycheque (20:8-15)
3.  Me First? (20:16)

{Repeat}

That's where we're heading this morning. Now, there is only one more question to ask: Are you still comfortably? Then let's begin.

## 1. The eccentric Employer (20:1-17)

Firstly then, the eccentric Employer. Jesus begins his parable in chapter 20, verse 1 by comparing the Kingdom of Heaven to a "landowner who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard." Immediately, before Jesus even begun to flesh out the story he has already given us some tools to help us unearth what this parable is trying to tell us. So what do we know from verse 1?

Firstly, we know that this parable is about the kingdom of Heaven - which is Matthew's way of saying the Kingdom of God. It is a parable that is going to help us to understand what life is like for those who live under God's all powerful rule.

Secondly, Jesus is going to explain what life looks like for citizen's of God's empire by comparing the kingdom of God to man who hire's workers for his vineyard. Now this point is particualy, important because Jesus is going to introduce us to more characters as the story progresses but we must not be distracted by them. Important they might be, but they are not the main players in this story. The most important character is the landowner, because it is his actions that are going to illustrate to us what life in the kingdom is all about.

So as we take a look at the landowner, try to keep this question in mind: {Slide} "to what extent does the landowner reveal what life is like in God's kingdom?" Let's see if we can answer that question in our first two sections.

Having set the scene and provided some important clues, Jesus' story begins to unfold. Heading to the marketplace the landowner finds some men who were willing to do a days works (6am-6pm) in exchange for a dinarius each. A dinarius being the going rate for a days work in the first century the men agree a head off to work. During Jesus day, hired workers were often take advantage of, but by agreeing the price in advance, and offering a fair wage, Jesus wants us to see that this particular landowner is both fair and honourable in the way he hires his staff.

At the third hours (about 9am) the landowner returns to the marketplace to hire more workers for his vineyard (v3). Well that's not very surpring, any man whose undertaken a bit of gardening knows that sometimes, it is only when you are part way through a job that you realise how much work is involved. And in v4, again the subjct of pay emerges but this time the landowner promises to pay them "what is right" for the work that they put in over the remainder of the day. But what would have made the landowners actions so strange to Jesus first hearers, and what should capture our attention too, is that the landowner does this the landowner goes out three more times: at midday, at 3pm, and then finally, and most bizarrely of all, an hour before home time.

In verse 6, we're told that the landowner finds a gang of workers still waiting to be hired at the eleventh hour (about 5pm). When the landowner asks them why they've been standing there all day long, they reply in v7 by stating the obvious "because no one has hired us!" You don't say! But notice that our landowner doesn't press the issue, instead he sends them off to the vineyard with only an hour left in the working day. And in doing so Jesus leaves us to fill in the blanks - for better or worse - as to why these men had not been hired earlier.

And that is significant because depending on how we fill in that blank will affect how we view the landowner at this point. If we think the worst, and assume that these men hadn't been hired because they have a reputation for being lazy or dishonest, then by hiring them the landowner shows himself to be gracious. His actions are gracious because in giving them a job, even for an hour, he gives them what they do not deserve - an honest wage to take home to their families. If we think the best, and assume that these men haven't been hired because they are unskilled, ill, or elderly, then the landowner shows himself to a compassionate man. Someone who gladly hires those at the bottom of the social ladder, men which other employers would over look for stronger, younger, and skilled workers.

Either way were are presented with a landowner whose employment practicies are far from orthodox. Not only will he hire workers throughout the day, he'll even take those no one else wants. He'll even hire them at the eleventh hour. The eleventh hour was the final hour of the working day, about 5pm. Come 6 o'clock the workers would down tools, collect their paycheques and head home. So to hire men at 5pm would seem so bizarre to Jesus hearer, and it should seem strange to us too, eccentric even. By the time the men walked from town to the vineyard, checked in with the foreman, been assigned a task, and gone out to work, it would be time to clock off, get paid, and head home. This is crazy!

And yet in many ways the landowner represents those whom God welcomes into his kingdom, don't you think? Think about it, Like the landowner, God is honest and upfront with us from the start. He tells us that entrance into his kingdom comes only through turning from sin and trusting in Jesus death and return life. And like the landowner he also does what is right by us, he doesn't tell us that our salvation is a gift today, only to make us earn it tomorrow. Like the landowner God is merciful too. He is willing to overlook our reputation for sin, stubbornness, and rebellion, by giving us what we don't deserve by giving us another shot at a renew relationship with him. And he is compassionate also. It make no matter to him whether we are old or young, healthy or ill, unskilled or a rocket scientist, home owner or gypsy traveller, British resident ot illegal immigrant, God's love is directed towards any and all who cross his path in repentance and faith.

But all this only gives us a partial answer to our question from earlier. To fully understand how the landowners actions reveal what life is like in God kingdom, need to put down our tools, punch out, and head to the foreman's office to collect out pay. Only then will we have our answer, and only then will we begin to see how God's outrageous favour causes us to love our neighbour.
