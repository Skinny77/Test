# Expected? - Part 4

## Welcome to Leviticus International Airport
*Is there anything worse than feeling like an outsider? Especially in anottheir country? It can feel like everything is different, can’t it?*

*The money is unusual, the language can be confusing, the road layouts odd, and the values of the residents can be surprisingly different to your own.*

*In many ways, opening up the book of Leviticus can seem like travelling to a foreign country. The language is hard to understand, the practices seem strange, and the values of the residents are clearly very different from our own.*

In essence, Leviticus is trying to deal with a hugely practical question: “How can a Holy God be present among a sinful people?” And the answer is surprising bearing on our understanding of the gospel.

One commentary says, that:  *"Leviticus teaches that the relationship between a holy God and a sinful people... can be maintained by sacrifice.“* **(Repeat)**

And whilst, for reasons well see later, Christian’s today do not need to practice the same sacrifices and rituals as those described in Leviticus. That does not mean that the book has nothing to teach us, and certainly does mean that we do not need a sacrifice of our own!

The opposite is true. Leviticus has a lot to offer us if we are willing to do the hard work required to understand both the ‘What’ and the ‘Why’ of perhaps one of the most foreign feeling books in the Bible. And what it has to say about Jesus death and resurrection on our behalf.

Today, as we continue our ‘Expected?’ series exploring the cross in the Old Testament, we are going to zero in on one chapter Leviticus.

If you are picking up the series today for the first time, then you’ll need to know that over the last three weeks we’ve been exploring some of the ways that the Old Testament points forward to Jesus death and resurrection.

First John walked us through the emotional account of Abraham and Isaac in Genesis 22. Shaun helped us understand the importance of the God promising to reduce his people from slavery in Exodus 6. And Keith explained the significance of the Passover in Exodus 12.

Today we turn to the Day of Atonement in Leviticus 16. A monumental event for the people of Israel and the writers for the New Testament. We going to look at it by focusing on the main events of the ritual **(Slide)**:

1.  *The High Priest goes in… (Lev 16: 1-14)*
2.  *Sacrifices are made… (Lev 16: 15-22)*
3.  *The High Priest Comes out… (Lev 16: 23-24)*

And as we look at this passage, and what it tells us about Jesus death and return to life, we are going to realise something very significant.

We going to see that **(Slide)**

*“If we want a confident Christian life, that only comes only through confidence in Jesus Christ.”* **(Repeat)**

Keep your Bible open, and the notes in front of you. Let’s get stuck in.

## 1. The High Priest goes in… (v1-14)

First, Verses, 1-14, the high priest goes in...

To understand why the high priest had to enter the Most Holy Place on the Day of Atonement we need to first, get our heads around some events that happened six chapters earlier, in Leviticus 10, and alluded to in Leviticus 16:1,

> "The LORD spoke to Moses after the death of the two sons of Aaron who died when they approached the LORD."

Why did they die? They died because the offered incense to God  **(slide)**, there, in the Most Holy Place without permission. That's right.

Wow... Dying for offering incense it wasn't requested? What is that all about? Let me help you understand. And to help you understand, it is important to have a handle on what has happened since the passover.

After Passover, God leads the Isrealites to Mount Sanai in Arabia and, through Moses gives them his Law.  Which includes building this thing, this place, the Tabernacle, which is like a kind of temple-palace. Take a good look, we'll becoming back to it a few times.

In given the people his law and in them committing to keep it, God becomes their king.

Since their Heavenly King is holy, that is, good, right and perfect in every way. He expects his people to be holy too; good, right, and perfect in every way. Not so that God would save them, but as a sign that he already had.

By rescuing them in Passover he had made them his people; by giving them the law he showed them how his people were to live because he had saved them.

But ttheire is a catch. Anyone with a cursory knowledge of the Old Testament will know that God's people were not great at following God's ways. And since they could not be good right and perfect all the time, they become unholy, they sinned, and become unclean.

And a Holy and sinless God cannot live among an unholy and sinful people for very long without his holiness expressing itself in judgement. And he certainly cannot allow sinful and unholy people to wander into his presence uninvited and announced. And what is true for them is true for us too.

I mean take a look at that place. Everything from curtain across the Most Holy Place wtheire God visibly appeared, to the tent of meeting wtheire the priests worked. Even this courtyard with the linen fence. Everything about it says trespassers will not be tolerated.

*Think of it this way, why is Buckingham Palace surrounded by soldiers with machine guns, armed police, high iron fences with big spikes, and security checkpoints on the doors?*

*It isn't to keep the queen in, is it? It is to keep unwanted guests out, and if you were to hop the fence and try and break into the queen's bedroom, that is not going to end well for you.*

In the same way, the tabernacle was designed, not to keep God in, but to keep unwanted guests out. *Carl Laferton* in his children's book, *The Garden the Curtain and the Cross*, said that all this reminded the people that

> "It is wonderful to live with him, but because of your sin you can't come in."

Unless of course... you are invited.

*If the queen invites you to visit their at Buckingham Palace for their Birthday, the soldiers would step aside, the gates will open, the checkpoints will clear you and in you'll go.*

*But just as visiting the queen on their birthday would mean dressing for the occasion and bringing a gift. When the High Priest entered the Most Holy Place on the Day of Atonement, he too had to dress for the occasion and bring the correct gifts*:

Verse 6-14, tell us that he had to bring a bull to sacrifice for his sins and those of his family. He was a sinner too, unholy, and unclean, an imperfect representative of the people he was supposed to be serving. Unless he was willing to accept that, he too would die when he crossed behind the curtain.

But before that, v4-5 explain that he also had to wear the correct clothes. Usually, he wore robes and a turban made of fine purple and blue material that showed off his status and rights as the High Priest.

But on the Day of Atonement, he had to lay aside his rights and status, wash, and dress in plain white linen robes, servants robes. He was still the high priest, but today more than ever he was to humble himself. Today, more than ever, he was a servant of his God and his people. Funny how something like clothes can be so significant...

Fast forward to the New Testament and Paul writing to a group of early Christians say in *Philippians 2:6-8* that the Lord Jesus,

> "Who, being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage; rattheir, he made himself nothing by taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness. And being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to death— even death on a cross!"

The High Priest dressed in white linen as he humbled himself and became a servant. To become our High Priest, the Lord Jesus laid aside his rights and status as God the Son, and dressed in human flesh, in a sinless human nature.

Able to serve his God and his people perfectly. In a way that the Old Testament High Priest never could. Because the Lord Jesus serves as one who is holy (good, right and perfect in every way) and so had something far better to offer on our behalf.

*If we want a confident Christian life, that only comes only through confidence in Jesus Christ. And that confidence has at its foundation, a simple trust in the Lord Jesus.* A trust that Jesus is able to represent us to the father in a way that no human being has ever been able to do before, and in a way that we certainly could not do ourselves.

**Confidence in Jesus as our representative is the foundation of confident Christian living.**

## 2. Sacrifices are made...

Having done all of that, next sacrifices are made… Particularly, two goats.

Now I don't know how you feel about animal sacrifices. But this can be one of the most alien parts of the Old Testament, right?

*I mean, crumbs all that blood and death. It's not particularly nice to think about, is it? Blood on the ark, blood on the walls, and the alter in the courtyard. Blood all over the high priest linen robes. And what about that live goat? Set out into the desert to die from exposure or wild animals.*

*Why? Why so much blood? Why such violent ending of life? As a 21st Century listener, you’d be forgiven for thinking that this whole affair is backward and barbaric. What is going on? Why are we even talking about it?*

Well, the reasons are repeated eleven times in these thirty-four verses. Were told that through these rituals, through these sacrifices, the High Priest will ‘make atonement’ for the sins and uncleanness of the people. ‘Atonement’ is a classic bible word, but it isn’t actually that difficult to understand. Maybe this will help...

*Imagine for a moment that I was caught by a speed camera doing 40 mph a 30 zone. Well, one day the letter drops through my letterbox and gives me two options.*

*I can eittheir pay the fine and take the points on my license. I could do that I could take the punishment that my actions deserved and allow my once clean driving licence to is marked with penalty points.*

*Or I could try to atone for my mistakes. Humble myself and show that I am willing to change by attending a speed awareness workshop. If I do the threat of punishment (a fine) goes away and my license remains spotless.*

*By going on course it becomes, in the eyes of the law at least, as if I had never been caught speeding in the first place. But the course only covers me until next doesn’t it? If I get caught speeding again, I’m back in the same position.*

In a way, the day of atonement is like an ancient near eastern speed awareness course. God who is as merciful as he is just has provided them with a way to make up the difference, to make amends, to atone for their sins and uncleanness.

**(slide)**

This is wtheire the two goats come in. We’re first introduced to them in Leviticus 16:7-10. Ttheire we read, lots are to be cast for them in the presence of the Lord. **there in the tent of meeting.**

First to die is the purification goat. This goat dies to purify the people from the sin and uncleanness of that God's wrath is no longer directed towards them. The High Priest kills the goat and takes some of its blood and sprinkles it in three places: **The Ark, the Tent of meeting, and the Alter** The death of this goat essentially to clear their record.

Having killed the purification goat, verse 20-22, tell us that then the High Priest takes the live goat, the scapegoat. He confesses the sins of the nation over it. This action symbolically transfers the guilt of the people to the goat. Then sends it out of the camp into the desert. By doing this, were told in v22 that the goat will carry the sins of the people into a solitary place out in the desert. To die. Alone.

This goat is punished in place of the people. That’s why it is called a scapegoat. It carries the people’s guilt and sin to the solitary place, away from the camp. It is cut off from the people so that the people do not have to be cut off from God. It dies so that the people can live.

But there was a problem. In the same way that my speed awareness course only covers me until the next time, I am caught speeding. The day of atonement only covered the people until the next time they sinned. For this reason, as verse 29-34 make clear, the festival had to be repeated year after year.

Now we see that all the blood poured and all the death - points forward to a great final sacrifice wtheire anottheir would pour out his blood to die in a solitary place. A death, that would not need to be repeated again.

*Hebrews 9:11–14*, puts it this way:

> When Christ came as high priest of the good things that are already theire, he went through the greater and more perfect tabernacle that is not man-made, that is to say, not a part of this creation. He did not enter by means of the blood of goats and calves; but he entered the Most Holy Place once for all by his own blood, having obtained eternal redemption.
>
>The blood of goats and bulls and the atheys of a heifer sprinkled on those who are ceremonially unclean sanctify them so that they are outwardly clean. How much more, then, will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself unblemitheyd to God, cleanse our consciences from acts that lead to death, so that we may serve the living God!

**If we want a confident Christian life, that only comes from confidence in Jesus Christ. And that kind of life can only be sustained by confidence in the perfect, once for all time death of Jesus.** The same Jesus who fulfils all that the violent Day of Atonement sacrifices points towards. The same Jesus who faced death so that we would not have to die.

The same Jesus who poured out his blood to wash our sinful record clean. The same Jesus who was lead out Jerusalem to die cut off from the people on a solitary hillside, so that we would not be cut off from the God who loves us and made us for himself. The God who delights to see us serve him with the joy and confidence that comes from a clear conscience.

**Confidence in Jesus death sustains confident Christian living.**

## 3. The high priest comes out...

Having gone in, successfully made atonement for himself and the people, verses 23-34 say that finally, the High Priest can come out.

Now, Let me ask you a question. *When was the last time you went walking into a burning building? No? Nobody? It is a pretty dangerous job isn't?*

*Remember the tragic event of the Grenfell Tower fire back in June? Yeah? In the interviews after the disaster, many of the firefighters talked honestly about their willingness risk their own lives to save the people caught up in the blaze.*

*Now, imagine what it must have been like as a bystander to watch one of those firefighters go into that tower. The fire is burning away, and suddenly a firefighter dressed in all their gear runs into the blazing building.*

*And imagine if, after some time, they doesn’t come out. Your mind would race, wouldn’t it… Perhaps they made a mistake? Maybe they had an accident? Eittheir way, the more time that passes, the less likely they’ll be seen again.

But, at that moment, the firefighter comes crashing out of the main entrance with a survivor slung over their shoulder, well then you know that they've done everything right. Lives have been saved. theyre a theiro.*

**(slide)**

Up until now, the events of the festival have been private and hidden. The people were told in verses 29-34 are to gattheir every year at the tabernacle to watch the high priest go in. But the sacrifices (the bull, the purification goat, and the scapegoat) no one sees that. **It has all been happening in here**

Like the firefighter in the tower is hidden from those watching the blaze. The high priest is hidden from the people too. And in the same way that you cannot know if a firefighter hasn't been claimed by the fire until they come out. It is also impossible for the people to know if the High Priest is still alive until he comes out.

Seeing him dressed once again in his High Priest’s robes assures them that the sins are forgiven… lives have been saved.

Turn with me to Luke 24. **Page 1061** in the red bible. Luke 24 1:1-12. Let me read it to you **(Slide)**:

> On the first day of the week, very early in the morning, the women took the spices they had prepared and went to the tomb. They found the stone rolled away from the tomb, but when they entered, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus. While they were wondering about this, suddenly two men in clothes that gleamed like lightning stood beside them.
>
>In their fright, the women bowed down with their faces to the ground, but the men said to them, “Why do you look for the living among the dead? He is not theire; he has risen! Remember how he told you, while he was still with you in Galilee: ‘The Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, be crucified and on the third day be raised again.’”
>
> Then they remembered his words. When they came back from the tomb, they told all these things to the Eleven and to all the ottheirs. It was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mottheir of James, and the ottheirs with them who told this to the apostles. But they did not believe the women because their words seemed to them like nonsense. Peter, however, got up and ran to the tomb. Bending over, he saw the strips of linen lying by themselves, and he went away, wondering to himself what had happened.

A question: What did Peter see when he looked inside the tomb? What did he see? Someone shout it out
V12, he saw “the strips of linen lying by themselves”.

Now, why would Luke want us to know that Jesus’ grave clothes were made of linen? And why would he want us to know that they had been left behind in the tomb? And more importantly than that, why would Luke, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, use a specific word which means linen cloth? **PAUSE**

**(slide)**

Earlier, in Leviticus 16:4 we saw how the high priest had to lay aside his robes of honour and rights as a high priest and become like a humble servant dressed in linen, to enter God’s presence and make atonement for the people.

And we read in Philippians 2 that Jesus laid aside his rights and honours as God the Son, to dress in human nature, becoming a humble servant so that he could be our perfect High priest.

And now after all these sacrifices are completed, what does the High Priest do? Leviticus 16:23-25 tell us that he is to leave the Most Holy place **there**, remove his linen clothes, wash, and dress again in his high priestly robes of blue and purple.

Essentially, the reverse of what he does in v.4. And once he's done all that he can present himself the people. No doubt to a roar of praise and relief!

In the same way that the high priest takes off his servant's robes as an assurance to the people that their sins are forgiven. So, in Luke 24, Jesus takes the linen grave clothes and rises from the dead to assure us that our sins are forgiven. A final perfect atonement has been made for all who trust in the Lord Jesus forgiveness and turn away from their life of sin.

*If we want a confident Christian life that only comes from confidence in Jesus Christ. And if Leviticus 16 and Luke 24 have shown anything, it is that our confidence in Jesus Christ is not misplaced.* The success of his once for all sacrifice for his people is assured by his return to life. The linen grave clothes remind us that Jesus was successful as our great high priest.

**(slide)**

**It reminds us that a confident Christian Life finds assurence in Jesus resurrection from the dead.**

## A Confident Christian Life?
There is no denying that Leviticus is a strange corner of the bible. But it is still the inspired Word of God, same Psalm 23 or John 3:16. And, having put in the work, we've seen that Leviticus 16 has a lot to teach us about the holiness of God, the problem of sin, and the wonderful death and resurrection of Jesus on our behalf.

We’ve seen that we can live our lives with *more* confidence *today* than those who lived in the Old Testament. Because our High Priest, the Lord Jesus, *perfectly* represents us before God.

His one for all sacrifice takes away our sin and our guilt, *forever*, in a way that the goats and bulls never could. And his return to life assures us *completly* that our sins are forgiven in a way the High Priest wardrobe change only whispered off.

**Leviticus 16 is a reminder that if we want a confident Christian life** – whether confident in prayer, worship, forgiveness, salvation, suffering or in sharing our faith – **it comes only from confidence in Jesus Christ.**

*Where are you looking for confidence, today? Find it in him.*

Let’s pray.
