# Expected? - Part 4

## Introduction
Is there anything worse than feeling like an outsider? Especially in other country? Everything changes doesn’t it? speech sounds strange.
The money is unusual, the language can be confusing, the road layouts odd, and the values of the natives can be surprisingly different to your own. And that’s just America!

Seriously though, opening up the book of Leviticus can seem like travelling to a foreign country. The language is hard to understand, the practices seem strange, and the values of the natives are clearly different from our own.

In essence, Leviticus is trying to deal with a hugely practical question: “How can a Holy God be present among a sinful people?” And the answer is surprising bearing on our understanding of the gospel. One book answer that question this way:  "Book of Leviticus teaches that the relationship between a holy God and a sinful people... can be maintained by sacrifice.“ **(Repeat)**

And whilst, for reasons well see later, Christian’s today do not need to practice the same sacrifices and rituals as those described in Leviticus. That does not mean that the book has nothing to teach us, and certainly does mean that we do not need a sacrifice of our own!

The opposite is true. Leviticus has a lot to offer us if we are willing to do the hard work required to understand both the ‘What’ and the ‘Why’ of perhaps one of the most foreign feeling books in the Bible. And what it has to say about Jesus death and resurrection on our behalf.

Today, as we continue our ‘Expected?’ series exploring the cross in the Old Testament, we are going to zero in on one chapter Leviticus..
If you are picking up the series today for the first time, then you’ll need know that over the last three weeks we’ve been exploring some of the ways that the Old testament points forward to Jesus death and resurrection.

First John walked us through the emotional account of Abraham and Isaac in Genesis 22. Shaun helped us understand the importance of the God promising to reduce his people from slavery in Exodus 6. And Keith explained the significance of the Passover in Exodus 12.

Today we turn to the Day of Atonement in Leviticus 16. A monumental events for the people of Israel and the writers for the New Testament. We going to look at it by focusing on the main events of the ritual:

1.  The High Priest goes in… (Lev 16: 1-14)
2.  Sacrifices are made… (Lev 16: 15-22)
3.  The High Priest Comes out… (Lev 16: 23-24)

And as we look at this passage, and what it tells us about Jesus death and return to life, we are going to realise something very significant.

We going to see that **“A confident Christian life only comes only from confidence in Jesus Christ.”** **(Repeat)**

Keep your bible open, and the notes in front of you. Let’s get stuck in.

## 1. The High Priest goes in… (v1-14)

First, the high priest goes in...

This is essentially the same situation for Aaron and the priests. Here’s a mock up of what the Tabernacle looked like in the days of Leviticus 16. Gates, fences, area where only the priest could go. And beyond that an area where only the high priest could go, as Verse 2 says, once a year, when summoned on the Day of Atonement. And he has to enter the correct way, to do that two things are required of him:

## 2. Sacrifices are made...

Having done all of that, next sacrifices are made…

Now I don't know how you feel about animal sacrifices. But this can be one of the most alien parts of the Old Testament, right? I mean, crumbs all that blood and death. Its not particularly nice to think about is it? Blood on the ark, blood on the walls, and the alter in the courtyard. Blood all over the high priest linen robes. And what about the live goat? Set out into the desert to die from exposure or wild animals.

Why? Why so much blood? Why such violent ending of life? As a 21st Century listener you’d could be forgiven for thinking that this whole affair is backward and barbaric. What is going on? Why are we even talking about it?

Well the reasons is repeated eleven times in these thirty-four verses. Were told that through these rituals, through these sacrifices, the High Priest will ‘make atonement’ for the sins and uncleanness of the people. ‘Atonement’ is a classic bible words, but it isn’t actually that difficult to understand. Maybe this will help...

*Imagine for a moment that I was caught by a speed camera doing 40 mph a 30 zone. Well one day the letter drops through my letter box and gives me two options. I can either pay the fine and take the points on my license. I could do that I could take the punishment that my actions deserved and allow my once clean driving licence to is marked with penalty points.*

*Or I could try to atone for my mistakes. Humble myself and show that I am willing change by attending a speed awareness workshop. If I do the threat of punishment (a fine) goes away and my license remains spotless. By going on course it becomes, in the eyes of the law, as if I had never been caught speeding in the first place.*

*But the course only covers me until next doesn’t it? If I get caught speeding again, I’m back in the same position.*

In a way the day of atonement is like an ancient near eastern speed awareness course. God who is as merciful as his is just has provided them away to make up the difference, to make amends, to atone for their sins and uncleanness.

This is where the two goats come in. We’re first introduced to them in Leviticus 16:7-10. There we read, lots are are to be cast for them in the presence of the Lord. Here in the tent of meeting. The first chosen to be a sin offering for the people, to purify them. The second, a scapegoat, is to be sent out into the desert.

First to die is the purification goat. This goat dies to purify the people from the sin and uncleanness of that God's wrath is no longer directed towards them. The High Priest kills the goat and take some of its blood and sprinkle it in three places: **The Ark, the Tent of meeting, and the Alter** The death of this goat essentially clears their record.

Having killed the purification goat, verse 20-22, tell us that then the high Priest takes the live goat, the scapegoat. He confess the sins over the nation over it. This action symbolically transfers the guilt of the people to the goat. Then sends it out of the camp into the desert. By  doing this, were told in v22 that the goat will carries the sins of the people into a solitary place out in the desert. To die. Alone.

This goat is punished in their place. It carries their guilt and sin to the solitary place, away from the camp. It is cut off from the people, so that the people do not have to be cut off from God.

But their was a problem. In the same way that my speed awareness course only covers me until the next time I am caught speeding. The day of atonement only covered the people until the next time they sinned. For this reason, as verse 29-34 make clear, the festival had to be repeated year after year. Now we see that all the blood and all the death - points forward to a great final sacrifice that would not need to be repeated again.

*Hebrews 9:11–14*, puts it this way:

> When Christ came as high priest of the good things that are already here, he went through the greater and more perfect tabernacle that is not man-made, that is to say, not a part of this creation. He did not enter by means of the blood of goats and calves; but he entered the Most Holy Place once for all by his own blood, having obtained eternal redemption. The blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkled on those who are ceremonially unclean sanctify them so that they are outwardly clean. How much more, then, will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself unblemished to God, cleanse our consciences from acts that lead to death, so that we may serve the living God!

**If a confident life as a Christian comes only from confidence in Jesus Christ. Then that kind of life can only be sustained by confidence in once for all time death of Jesus.** The same JEsus who fulfills all that the Day of Atonement sacrifices point forward to. The same Jesus who faced death so that we would not have to face God's warth. The same Jesus who poured out his blood to wash our sinful record clean. The same Jesus who was lead out Jerusalem to die cut of from his people on a solitary hillside, so that we would not be cut off from the God who loves as and made us for himself. But might serve him with the joy that comes from a clear conscience.

**Confidence in Jesus death sustains confident Christian living.**

## 3. The high priest comes out...

Having gone in, successfully made atonement for himself and the people, verses 23-34 say that finally, the High Priest can come out.

Now, Let me ask you a question. *When was the last time you walking into a burning building? No? Nobody? It is a pretty dangerous job isn't?*

*Remember the tragic event of the Grenfell Tower fire back in June? Yeah? In the interviews after the disaster, many of the firefighters talked honestly about their willingess risk their own lives to save the people caught up in the blaze. Now, imagine what it must have been like as a bystander to watch one of those firefighters go into that tower. The fire is burning away, and sudden a firefighter dress in all her gear runs into the blaze builing.*

*And imagine if, after some time, she doesn’t come out. Perhaps she made a mistake? Maybe she had an accident? Either way, the more time that passes, the less likely she’ll be seen again. But, if after sometime she comes crashin out of the main entrance with a survivor slung over her shoulder, well than you know that she's done everything right. Lives have been saved. She's a hero.*

Up until now, the events of the festival have been private and hidden. The people we’re told in verse 29-34 are to gather every year at the tabernacle to watch the high priest go in. But sacrifices (the bull, the purification goat, and confessing over the scapegoat) no one see that. Like the firefighter in the tower is hidden from the watching world. The high priest is hidden from the people too. And in the same way that you cannot know if a firefighter hasn't been calimed by the fire until they come out. It is also impossible for the people to know if the High Priest is still alive until he comes out.

Turn with me to Luke 24. Page 1061 in the red bible. Luke 24 1:1-12. Let me read it to you:

> On the first day of the week, very early in the morning, the women took the spices they had prepared and went to the tomb. They found the stone rolled away from the tomb, but when they entered, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus. While they were wondering about this, suddenly two men in clothes that gleamed like lightning stood beside them. In their fright the women bowed down with their faces to the ground, but the men said to them, “Why do you look for the living among the dead? He is not here; he has risen! Remember how he told you, while he was still with you in Galilee: ‘The Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, be crucified and on the third day be raised again.’”
>
> Then they remembered his words. When they came back from the tomb, they told all these things to the Eleven and to all the others. It was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the others with them who told this to the apostles. But they did not believe the women, because their words seemed to them like nonsense. Peter, however, got up and ran to the tomb. Bending over, he saw the strips of linen lying by themselves, and he went away, wondering to himself what had happened.

A question: What did Peter see when he looked inside the tomb? What did he see? Someone shout it out
V12, he saw “the strips of linen lying by themselves”. Now why would Luke want us to know that Jesus’ grave clothes were made of linen? And why would he want us to know that they had been left behind in the tomb. And more importantly than that, why would Luke, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, use a specific word which means linen cloth? **PAUSE**

Earlier, in Leviticus 16:4 we saw how the high priest had to lay aside his robes of honour and rights as a high priest and become like a humble servant dressed in linen, to enter God’s presence and make atonement for the people. And we read in Philippians 2 that Jesus lad aside his rights and honours as God the Son, to dress himself in human nature, becoming a humble servant so that he could be our perfect High priest.

And now after all these sacrifices are completed, what does the HIgh Priest do? Leviticus 16:23-25 tell us that he is to leave the most holy place **here**, remove his linen robes, washes, and dress himself in his high priestly robes of blue and purple. Essentially the reverse of what he does in v.4. And once he's done all that he can present himself the the people. No doubt to a roar of praise!

Then in the same way that the high priest dress himself again and presents himself to the people. So, later in Luke 24, Jesus lays aside his servants robes, the linen grave clothes and rises from the dead as a sign that the atonement his has made has been excepted by the Father. And in the same way that the High Priest presents himself the people. The Resurrected Lord Jesus shows him to the travellers on the road to Emmaus, and then to the disciples, before ascending back to heaven to enjoy all the rights and honours that have been his for all eternity.

So if a confident Christian life only comes from confidence in Jesus Christ. Leviticus 16 and Luke 24 assure us that our confidence in Jesus Christ is not misplaced. The success of his once for all sacrifice for his people, is marked by his resurrection from the dead. The linen grave clothes assure us that Jesus was successful as our great high priest. We can live confident CHristian lives because Jesus work is done.


## Conclusion
There is no denying that Leviticus is a strange corner of the bible. But we have seen that Leviticus 16 has a lot to teach us about the holiness of God, the problem of sin, and the wonderfull death and resurrection of Jesus on our behalf.

We’ve seen that we can have *more* confidence today than those who lived in the Old Testament. Because our High Priest, the Lord Jesus, perfectly represents us before God. His one for all sacrifice takes away our sin and our guilt, forever, in a way that the goats and bulls never could. And his return to life assures us that his work is complete in a way the High Priest only whispered off.

Leviticus 16 is a reminder that a confident Christian life – whether confident in prayer, worship, forgiveness, salvation, suffering or in sharing our faith – comes only from confident in Jesus Christ.

Let’s pray.
