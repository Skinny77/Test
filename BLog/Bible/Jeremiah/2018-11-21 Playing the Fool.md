# The Secret of Faithful Parenting

Picture the scene, you're in the car heading home. You've just picked up your ten-year-old son from school. "how was your day?" you ask.

"Fine" They reply.

"Anything interesting happen today?"

"Ummm. I found an almond branch in the playground and then pot boiled over in the school canteen."

"Oh really... That’s nice dear"

"Yep, and now I need you to take me to a BBC newsroom."

Pregnant pause.

"Um why?", you inquire.

"because I have a message from God. If the nation doesn't turn back to him then the Russians are going to invade and burn down the houses of parliament!"

"Uh and did God say when this invasion was going to take place?"

"2058 - so we've got to hurry!"

## The Pint-sized Prophet

As bizarre as that conversation sounds, that is pretty much the mission God gives to young Jeremiah (Jeremiah 1:1-19, esp v11-19). **Warn them of coming judgement and call them back to me.**

Take verse 10, for example, God tells Jeremiah that his mission would be more about judgement than hope. But it would still contain some hope. Through this judgement, God would still work to rebuild and replant his people. Even if most of that building and planting wouldn't begin until the people were already in Babylon (cf. Jeremiah 29:1-16).

It was a hard mission Lord called him to. For most of his forty year career, Jeremiah was accused of being a liar (43:1-3), a false prophet (26:7-11), a traitor (38:1-6), a deserter (37:11-16), and conspiring with foreign powers (43:3). And even when Babylon was at the door, and his prophecies were being fulfilled, still the people and their rulers would not listen to God and his prophet (see for example, Jeremiah 36).

Jeremiah was imprisoned (37:15-16), put in public stocks (20:1-2), and even thrown down a well and left to die (38:6). His mission was opposed by the people, the priests, false prophets, and kings. Even those from his hometown of Anathoth tried to have him killed (11:18-23).

On top of the burden of his mission, he was often burdened by his own doubts and depression (Jeremiah 20:7-20). In the end, Jeremiah dragged off to in Egypt against his will - the very last place he wanted to be (43:1-7).

Given all that Jeremiah would face as he grew into his mission, it makes sense that his encounter with God would end in v17-19 with both a charge and a promise.

Jeremiah's charge in v17 has three parts.

1.  Jeremiah is to prepare himself for what lies ahead like a soldier prepares for war.
2.  He is to only speak what the Lord tells him to speak.
3.  And he is to fear offending his God more than he fears offending the people.

## Fearful of Looking Foolish?

**For many of us, it's that last part Jeremiah's charge which is the hardest**. We know in theory that the answer to fear in evangelism is to fear offending God more than offending the world. But often it is much harder in pracrice. At times Jeremiah seemed to know implicitly how to fear the Lord more than people, at other times he would have to learn it the hard way.

The Lord knows that the road ahead will be hard for Jeremiah, so he follows up the charge with a promise. In v18-19, God promises to keep Jeremiah as secure as a fortified city, as strong as an iron pillar, and as immovable as a bronze wall. But notice that this is not a promise of an easy life, God never makes that promise to anyone.

**Like us, Jeremiah is called to live a cross-shaped life, marked by perseverance and self-denial.** And even though people fight against him they would never overcome him - Through Jeremiah, God would always have the last word.

**Many would consider it utterly foolish to put such huge expectations on a child so young**. Surely the weight of the task will crush him, he is bound to give up. And on occasion Jeremiah almost did. But he is God's prophet, his words are God's words, and where God's word is, there the Holy Spirit is too. **God's presence would go with God's prophet to guide and protect his faith every step of the way.**

## Someone Greater than Jeremiah

When we consider all that Jeremiah will endure throughout his life it is hard not to think of Jesus. Misunderstood by rulers, opposed by the religious establishment, and rejected by his own people (see for example Mark 14-15). Along with all the might of Satan himself, they fought against him and for a time it looked like the succeeded. They hung him on a cross, left him to die, and then sealed his body in a tomb.

But Jesus was adamant from the beginning that as foolish as it sounded this was his mission all along (Luke 24:7). His death would pay the price for our sin and bring life and hope to his people (Mark 10:45). As foolish as the cross looked, it wasn't the end. Jesus rose again in victory three days later, breaking the curse of death and securing eternal life of us, forever.

And **in Matthew 28:16-20 Jesus gives us, his people, a mission, to share this news with everyone everywhere.** To go and tell what he has done and why people need to turn from sin and trust in him. And Like Jeremiah's mission, many consider our mission a fools errand.

But Jesus promises us that he will be with his people through the good times and the bad... even to the very end of the age. He knew it wouldn't always be easy. Becasus **Jesus know better than anyone, that being faithful to the mission, means being prepared to look foolish to the world**.

## Foolishness Beings at Home

As a husband and a dad, one of things I reguarly have to remind myself is that the mission Jesus has set me to make disciples doesn't begin when I walk out of the door in the morning. It begins much early; it begins when I wake up in the morning.

The discipleship mission begins when I say 'good morning' to my sons, when I hug them, and tell them that I love them. They are a reminder to me that God has commissioned me to be a father-missionary to my own children. Afterall, their hearts are just as deceitful (Jeremiah 17:9) and in need of the gospel as any other human being God puts across my path that day.

Yet like Jeremiah, and countless other parents, it is all to  easy to feel overwhelmed and inadequite for the task God has for us. Especially, when ours, and our chidlrens, failures make us feel like fools. So what's the answer? What is the secret of being faithful, to being parents who are always following Christ? What clues does Jeremiah 1:1-19 give us?

Looking at this passage it would be all too easy to say that like Jeremiah we need to stand up and be ready. To not make excuses for our feelings of weakness but to be prepared to say and do whatever it takes.

To fear God more than we fear upsetting or disappointing our children. We need to become parents that are as secure as a fortress, strong as an iron pillar, and unmoving in our parenting as a bronze wall.

Maybe there is some truth there but it forgets something important.

## The Secret to Faithful Parenting

The lesson Jeremiah was to take from this encounter was not to simply pull his socks up and try harder - that way ultimately leads to ruin and dispare. No, **the lesson we need to learn from Jeremiah is that being parents who are faithful _to_ God means trusting in the faithfulness _of_ God.**

-   A God who has sworn that he will be on watch to ensure that his word fulfils his purposes no matter what (Jeremiah 1:11-12; 2 Timothy 3:16-17).

-   A God who has sworn to give us the words to say when we need them most (Matthew 10:18-20), just as he did for Jeremiah (Jeremiah 1:9-10).

-   And a God who has sworn that whenever we go, and whatever we do, we don’t need to fear tantrums and stubborn chidlren (Philippians 4:6-7). His presence, the Holy Spirit, will be with us every moment of every day (Matthew 28:20).

Sure we might be make mistakes, and at times our children might make us feel like complete fools. Othertimes we'll do a good job of that without their help. But if Jeremiah 1:1-19 has taught me anything, it is that **if we want to be faithful to Christ, we are going to look foolish from time to time.**
