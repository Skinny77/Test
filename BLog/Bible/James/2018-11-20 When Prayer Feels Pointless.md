# When Prayer Feels Pointless

Have you ever spent ages writing an important email, hit send and walked away, only to find out later that’s its bounced back? Message undelivered!

Have you ever posted a letter or parcel only have it reappear at your door covered in red stickers? Returned to sender!

Or perhaps, you need to get hold of someone urgently and they won’t pick up their phone. You decided to leave a message, but it is no good. Voicemail full!

Is there anything worse than feeling like contact is out of reach? Feeling that no matter what you try the lines of communication are down?

I wonder have you ever felt way in prayer? Felt that no matter what you ask, or say, or pray, that your words seem to float up only to bounce back, undelivered. As if someone in the heavenly sorting office is stamping your prayers return to sender. Leaving you feeling like God’s voicemail is full, he’s out of reach and the lines of communication are down? I know, at times, I have felt that way? What about you? Maybe, you are feeling like that right now.

## Powerful and Effective?

If so James 5:13-18 will be music to your ears. Take are read of it and allow the wonderful truths of this passage to refresh your heart. Let the Holy Spirit use to remind you what you already know deep down - prayer is never pointless. Here's what James has to say:

> Is anyone among you in trouble? Let them pray. Is anyone happy? Let them sing songs of praise. Is anyone among you sick? Let them call the elders of the church to pray over them and anoint them with oil in the name of the Lord. And the prayer offered in faith will make the sick person well; the Lord will raise them up. If they have sinned, they will be forgiven. Therefore confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective.
>
> Elijah was a human being, even as we are. He prayed earnestly that it would not rain, and it did not rain on the land for three and a half years. Again he prayed, and the heavens gave rain, and the earth produced its crops. **James 5:13–18**

I'm not going to bottom out all the nitty-gritty of this passage here.   Instead, I want you to notice is how often prayer features in these verses. The range of different circumstances in which prayer is deployed and the variety of people who are the prayed for and doing the praying.

In v13, James tells us to pray when we are in trouble. In v14, he tells us that if we are sick, then we are to ask the elders to pop over, and they will pray with us and anoint us with oil. We are also told to confess our sins to one another. Certainly, that includes confessing our dirty little secrets but perhaps more our run of the mill failings and struggles. Why? So that we can pray for each other.

In each of these situations James tells us that, all things being equal, our prayers will be powerful and effective. The person in trouble will be rescued. The sick person will be healed. And the spiritually sick will have their conscience healed. If there is one thing these prayers are not, then they are certainly not pointless.

James’ reason for this confidence is found at the end of v16. “The prayer of a righteous person," he tells us, is both “powerful and effective”. But to understand, what James means buy this and how it relates to Elijah, we first need to know what he means by a ‘righteous person’.

## The Prayer of the Righteous Person

In the New Testament, the word righteous is used in a few ways: Sometimes it describes a person’s character or behaviour (Matthew 1:19, NASB). And it would be tempting to think that this is what James means here. That the prayers that are most powerful and effective are those prayed by godly super saints and obedient prayer warriors. As if James were saying "The prayer of the _sinless_ person is powerful and effective."

But this is not how James uses the word ‘righteous’ here. The particular word that James uses refers to the way that God views a person after they have trusted in Jesus for salvation. They are righteous because they are declared or considered to be right with God through Christ. In other words, they are righteous not because they have been obedient to God's law, but because Jesus has been obedient to the law _on their behalf_!

When we understand this, suddenly, like a magic eye puzzle, James point comes into sharp focus. Those whom God considers right with him through faith are not a small set of super saints or prayer warriors, are they? Who are they then? Who are the ones considered right with God?

That's right, us! You and me! James is talking about, ordinary, average, every day, bog standard Christians - with all our struggles, weakness, and failings. Our prayers, yours and mine are not pointless, they are both powerful and effective. Powerful and effective, not because of who we are or what we have done for God, but because of who God is and what Jesus has done for us through his death and resurrection!

## A Very Human Example

This is why James points us to Elijah’s exploits in 1 Kings 17-18. He doesn’t use Elijah as an example of a super-saint or a prayer warrior, but instead, he reminds us in v17 that “Elijah was a human being, even as we are” - with all same struggles, weakness, and failings that we have.

In other words, he was someone that God considered righteous, right with him, because of Elijah’s trust in the promises of God. Elijah was a man who struggled against sin and sinful people, experiencing joy and suffering, hope and fear. And yet… and yet, God was pleased to answer his prayers - in spectacular ways - not because of Elijah’s character or his obedience made him deserving of it but because of God’s character and Christ’s future obedience on Elijah's behalf.

## Never Pointless

So the next time the enemy or your own sinful heart tries to convince that your prayers are pointless, remember: our prayers are not powerful and effective because of who are or what we do. Neither, do our prayers bounce back or return to the sender every time we have a bad day or feel like we’ve messed it all up. Our prayers are powerful and effective even when we don’t feel like they are. Because their power and effectiveness are not based on how we feel on earth, but how the one in Heaven feels about us.

And, incredibly, he delights to call us righteous in Christ Jesus.
